&#8220;Adam-ondi-Ahman, or &#8216;Diahman,' as it is familiarly known to the Saints, is located on the north bank of Grand River. It is situated, in fact, in a sharp bend of that stream. The river comes sweeping down from the northwest and here makes a sudden turn and runs in a meandering course to the northeast for some two or three miles, when it as suddenly makes another bend and flows again to the southeast. Grand River is a stream that has worn a deep channel for itself, and left its banks precipitous; but at &#8216;Diahman' that is only true of the south bank. The stream as it rushes from the northwest, strikes the high prairie land which at this point contains beds of limestone, and not being able to cut its way through, it veered off to the northeast, and left that height of land standing like palisades which rise very abruptly from the stream to a height of from fifty to seventy-five feet. The summit of these bluffs is the common level of the high rolling prairie, extending off in the direction of Far West. The bluffs on the north bank recede some distance from the stream, so that the river bottom at this point widens out to a small valley. The bluffs on the north bank of the river are by no means as steep as those on the south, and are covered with a light growth of timber. A ridge runs out from the main line of the bluffs into the river bottom some two or three hundred yards, approaching the stream at the point where the bend of the river is made. The termination of the bluff is quite abrupt, and overlooks a considerable portion of the river bottom.&#8230;North of the ridge on which the ruins of the altar were found, and running parallel with it, is another ridge, separated from the first by a depression varying in width from fifty to a hundred yards. This small valley with the larger one through which flows the Grand River, is the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman. &#8211; <br />

<strong>Prophet Brigham Young (1801 - 1877):</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;In the beginning, after the earth was prepared for man, the Lord commenced his work upon what is now called this American continent, where the Garden of Eden was made. In the days of Noah, in the days of the floating of the ark, he took the people to another part of the earth: the earth was divided, and there he set up his kingdom.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 8, p. 195, October 7, 1860<br />
<br />
&quot;Men have supposed that because the Ark rested on Ararat that the flood commenced there, or rather that it was from thence the Ark started to sail. But God in His revelations has informed us that it was on this choice land of Joseph where Adam was placed and the Garden of Eden was laid out&quot; <br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 11, p. 337<br />
<br />
&#8220;In the beginning, after this earth was prepared for man, the Lord commenced his work upon what is now called the American continent, where the Garden of Eden was made. In the days of Noah, in the days of the Boating of the ark, he took the people to another part of the earth. <br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>The Discourses of Brigham Young</em>, p. 102<br />
<br />
&#8220;You have been both to Jerusalem and Zion, and seen both. I have not seen either, for I have never been in Jackson County. Now it is a pleasant thing to think of and to know where the Garden of Eden was. Did you ever think of it? I do not think many do, for in Jackson County was the Garden of Eden. Joseph has declared this, and I am as much bound to believe that as to believe that Joseph was a prophet of God.&#8221;<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Apostle Heber C. Kimball (1801 - 1868):</strong><br />
<br />
&#8220;The Prophet Joseph called upon Brother Brigham, myself and others, saying, &#8216;Brethren, come, go along with me, and I will show you something.' He led us a short distance to a place where were the ruins of three altars built of stone, one above the other, and one standing a little back of the other, like unto the pulpits in the Kirtland Temple, representing the order of three grades of Priesthood; &#8216;There,' said Joseph, &#8216;is the place where Adam offered up sacrifice after he was cast out of the garden.' The altar stood at the highest point of the bluff. I went and examined the place several times while I remained there. <br />
<br />
- Apostle Heber C. Kimball, as quoted in Otten &amp; Caldwell, <em>Sacred Truths of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants</em>, v. 2, pp. 278-279; also in <em>The Life of Heber C. Kimball</em>, pp. 209-210<br />
<br />
<strong>Apostle Orson Pratt (1801 - 1881):</strong><br />
<br />
&#8220;We may, however, observe, that so far as new revelation has given us information on this subject, this Continent of ours may be ranked among the first lands occupied by the human family. The very first man who had dominion on the face of the earth, under the direction of the Heavens, once dwelt on this Continent, His name was Adam... It was on this land where both Noah built his ark, which was blown by the winds of Heaven away to the east, and landed on Ararat.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Apostle Orson Pratt, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 12, p. 338<br />
<br />
<strong>Prophet Wilford Woodruff (1807 - 1898):</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;Again President Young said Joseph the Prophet told me that the garden of Eden was in Jackson Co Missouri, &amp; when Adam was driven out of the garden of Eden He went about 40 miles to the Place which we Named Adam Ondi Ahman, &amp; there built an Altar of Stone &amp; offered Sacrifice. That Altar remains to this day. I saw it as Adam left it as did many others, &amp; through all the revolutions of the world that Altar had not been disturbed. Joseph also said that when the City of Enoch fled &amp; was translated it was where the gulf of Mexico now is. It left that gulf a body of water.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Prophet Wilford Woodruff, <em>Waiting for Word's End: The Diaries of Wilford Woodruff</em>, ed. by Susan Staker, 1993, p. 305, March 30, 1873<br />
<br />
<strong>Oliver B. Huntington:</em></strong><br />
<br />
&quot;Adam's Altar, which was mentioned, I have visited many times. I sat upon the wall of stone and reflected upon the scenes that had taken place thousands of years ago right where I was. There were the rocks that Father Adam used.... My father's house stood about two hundred and fifty yards from that altar, on the bottom land of Grand River, in the valley of Adam-on-Diahman.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Oliver B. Huntington, <em>Juvenile Instructor</em>, Nov. 15, 1895, p. 700-701<br />
<br />
<strong>Prophet Joseph Fielding Smith (1876 - 1972):</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;In accord with the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, we teach that the Garden of Eden was on the American continent located where the city of Zion, or the New Jerusalem will be built. When Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden, they eventually dwelt at a place called Adam-ondi-Ahman, situated in what is now Daviess County, Missouri.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Prophet Joseph Fielding Smith, <em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, v. 3, p. 74<br />
<br />
<strong>Apostle John A. Widtsoe (1872 - 1952):</strong><br />
<br />
&#8220;The location of the Garden of Eden in America, and at Independence, Missouri, clears up many a problem which the Bible account of Eden and its garden has left in the minds of students.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle John A. Widtsoe, <em>Evidences and Reconciliations</em>, pp. 395-397<br />
<br />
&quot;Since Adam called together seven generations of his descendants at Adam-ondi-Ahman, it can well be believed that there was his old homestead. If so, the Garden of Eden was probably not far distant, for it was the entrance at the east of the Garden which was closed against them at the time of the &#8216;fall' (Genesis 3:24). In fact, it has been commonly understood among the Latter-day Saints, from the teachings of the Prophet, that the temple was to be built in or near the location of the Garden of Eden.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Apostle John A. Widstoe, <em>Evidences and Reconciliations</em>, p. 396<br />
<br />
&#8220;That is the position of the Latter-day Saints today, with respect to the much-discussed location of the Garden of Eden. Adam, after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden, lived in the vicinity of the great Missouri and Mississippi rivers. As his descendants multiplied, they would naturally settle along the fertile and climatically acceptable river valleys. When the flood came in the days of Noah, the Mississippi drainage must have increased to a tremendous volume, quite in harmony with the Biblical account. Noah's ark would be floated on the mighty, rushing waters, towards the Gulf of Mexico. With favorable winds, it would cross the Atlantic to the Eastern continents. There the human race, in its second start on earth, began to multiply and fill the earth. The location of the Garden of Eden in America, and at Independence, Missouri, clears up many a problem, which the Bible account of Eden and its garden has left in the minds of students.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle John A. Widtsoe, <em>Evidences and Reconciliations</em>, 1960, pp. 396-397<br />
<br />
&#8220;Latter-day Saints know, through modern revelation, that the Garden of Eden was on the North American continent and that Adam and Eve began their conquest of the earth in the upper part of what is now the state of Missouri. It seems very probable that the children of our first earthly parents moved down along the fertile, pleasant lands of the Mississippi valley.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Apostle John A. Widtsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations, 1960, p. 127<br />
<strong><br />
<br />
Apostle Bruce R. McConkie (1915 - 1985):</strong><br />
<br />
&#8220;Adam was the first man of all men; Ahman is one of the names by which God was known to Adam. Adam-ondi-Ahman, a name carried over from the pure Adamic language into English, is one for which we have not been given a revealed, literal translation. As near as we can judge -- and this view comes down from the early brethren who associated with the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was the first one to use the name in this dispensation -- Adam-ondi-Ahman means the place or land of God where Adam dwelt.<br />
&#8220;Apparently the area included was a large one; at least, the revelations speak of the land, the valley, and the mountains of Adam-ondi-Ahman. They tell us that Christ himself &#8216;established the foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman' (D. &amp; C. 78:15-16), and that it included the place now known as Spring Hill, Daviess County, Missouri. (D. &amp; C. 116.)<br />
&#8220;Far West, Missouri, also appears to be included in the land of Adam-ondi-Ahman. On April 17, 1838, the Lord commanded his saints to assemble at Far West, which place, he said, was holy ground; and there they were to build a city. (D. &amp; C. 115.) By July 8 of that year, William Marks and Newel K. Whitney had not left their temporal concerns in Kirtland, Ohio, and were not assembling with the saints coming to Zion. In rebuking them the Lord said this: &#8216;Is there not room enough on the mountains of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and on the plains of Olaha Shinehah, or the land where Adam dwelt, that you should covet that which is but the drop, and neglect the more weighty matters? Therefore, come up hither unto the land of my people, even Zion.'<br />
&#8220;William Marks was told that he was to &#8216;preside in the midst of my people in the city of Far West,' and Newel K. Whitney was told to &#8216;come up to the land of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and be a bishop unto my people.' (D. &amp; C. 117.)<br />
&#8220;The early brethren of this dispensation taught that the Garden of Eden was located in what is known to us as the land of Zion, an area for which Jackson County, Missouri, is the center place. In our popular Latter-day Saint hymn which begins, &quot;Glorious things are sung of Zion, Enoch's city seen of old,&quot; we find William W. Phelps preserving the doctrine that &quot;In Adam-ondi-Ahman, Zion rose where Eden was.&quot;...<br />
&#8220;One of the greatest spiritual gatherings of all the ages took place in the Valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman some 5,000 years ago, and another gathering -- of even greater importance relative to this earth's destiny -- is soon to take place in that same location. Our revelations recite:<br />
&quot;Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman and there bestowed upon them his last blessing.<br />
&quot;And the Lord appeared unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince, the archangel. And the Lord administered comfort unto Adam, and said unto him: I have set thee to be at the head; a multitude of nations shall come of thee, and thou art a prince over them forever. And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with age, being fill of the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation.&quot; (D. &amp; C. 107:53-56.) <br />
<br />
- Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, <em>Mormon Doctrine</em>, p. 19-20<br />
<br />
&#8220;At that great gathering Adam offered sacrifices on an altar built for the purpose. A remnant of that very altar remained on the spot down through the ages. On May 19, 1838, Joseph Smith and a number of his associates stood on the remainder of the pile of stones at a place called Spring Hill, Daviess County, Missouri. There the Prophet taught them that Adam again would visit in the Valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, holding a great council as a prelude to the great and dreadful day of the Lord. (Mediation and Atonement pp. 69-70.) At this council, all who have held keys of authority will give an accounting of their stewardship to Adam. Christ will then come, receive back the keys, and thus take one of the final steps preparatory to reigning personally upon the earth.&#8221; (Dan. 7:9-14; Teachings, p. 157.) <br />
<br />
- Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, <em>Mormon Doctrine</em>, p. 21<br />
<br />
&#8220;Far West, Missouri, also appears to be included in the land of Adam-ondi-Ahman. On April 17, 1838, the Lord commanded his saints to assemble at Far West, which place, he said, was holy ground; and there they were to build a city. (D. &amp; C. 115.) By July 8 of that year, William Marks and Newel K. Whitney had not left their temporal concerns in Kirtland, Ohio, and were not assembling with the saints coming to Zion. In rebuking them the Lord said this: &#8216;Is there not room enough on the mountains of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and on the plains of Olaha Shinehah, or the land where Adam dwelt, that you should covet that which is but the drop, and neglect the more weighty matters? Therefore, come up hither unto the land of my people, even Zion.'&#8221; <br />

<strong>Prophet Ezra Taft Benson (1899 - 1994):</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;Consider how very fortunate we are to be living in this land of America&#8230;Many great events have transpired in this land of destiny. This was the place where Adam dwelt; this was the place where the Garden of Eden was; it was here that Adam met with a body of high priests at Adam-ondi-Ahman shortly before his death and gave them his final blessing, and the place to which he will return to meet with the leaders of his people (D&amp;C 107:53-57). This was the place of three former civilizations: that of Adam, that of the Jaredites, and that of the Nephites.&quot;<br />

&quot;A CORROBORATIVE DISCOVERY. <br />
A short time ago the Washington Post made a remarkable statement regarding the location of the Garden of Eden. It announced that Dr. Campbell, of Versailles had lately discovered that it was on this continent, and near where St. Louis now stands. That gentleman, according to the Post, asserted that the Mississippi River is the Euphrates of Scripture, and that the Bible furnishes evidence of the correctness of his conclusions. It is probable that Dr. Campbell is not aware of the fact that he is not the discoverer of what he now announces, the Prophet Joseph Smith having many years ago stated that the Garden of Eden was located in what is now known as the State of Missouri. The Prophet also pointed out the precise spot where Adam offered sacrifice to the Lord, and where, as the great patriarchal head of the race, he blessed his children previous to his departure from the earth. That sacred spot in Missouri was designated by the Prophet as Adam-ondi-Ahman, the meaning of which is--the land where Adam dwelt.&quot;<br />

&#8220;I sometimes wish that every member of the Church could have the privilege of going to Liberty, and Richmond, Far West, Adam-ondi-Ahman, and Haun's Mill, on their way east or west, as they come through the Central States Mission, for the impression that it gives them, for the increase in their faith and their reverence for the work that has been performed in this Church by its founders and leaders. One cannot stand upon the hill overlooking the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman without being very deeply impressed with the sacredness of the place.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;I have been privileged to feel the nearness of President McKay's spirit. I have felt the majesty of his soul as we stood in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, observing in the short distance a place there known as Spring Hill, referred to in Section 116 of the Doctrine and Covenants as the place where Adam, Michael, or the &#8216;Ancient of Days,' in accordance with the prophecy of Daniel, shall in the due time of the Lord visit the earth for an important reason, and while there hearing President McKay utter quietly, &#8216;This is a most holy place.'<br />

<br />
&#8220;Shortly after his arrival Joseph rowed up the Grand River to Lyman Wight's ferry to explore land on the north bank in Daviess County [Missouri]. On a high bluff overlooking the river someone in the party discovered the ruins of what seemed to be an altar and excitedly led the prophet to it. After examining it Joseph stood silent, his eyes sweeping over the prairie that rolled away beneath him....The glory of the scene made Joseph heady as with new wine. &#8216;This is the valley of God in which Adam blessed his children,' he said, &#8216;and upon this very altar Adam himself offered up sacrifices to Jehovah....we will lay out a city which shall be called Adam-ondi-Ahman. Here Adam, the Ancient of Days, shall come to visit his people....'&#8221; <br />

&quot;On the basis of currently available information it would appear that the one that locates Eden near the head of the Persian Gulf combines the greatest number of probabilities of every kind.&quot; <br />
