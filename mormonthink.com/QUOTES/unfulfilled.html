Note: This section is not even close to being complete; however, you should be able to get the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world&quot; <br />
<br />
- Holy Bible, 1 John 4:1<br />
<br />
&quot;Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Holy Bible, Matthew 7:15<br />
<br />
Joseph Smith predicted in 1835 that:<br />
<br />
&quot;The coming of the Lord, which was nigh - even fifty-six years should wind up the scene.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., in <em>History of the Church</em>, vl. 2, p. 182. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following: Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man; therefore let this suffice, and trouble me no more on this matter. <br />
<br />
- Doctrine and Covenants 130:14-15<br />
<br />
On July 8, 1838, Joseph Smith foretold that the name of Oliver Granger would be remembered &quot;from generation to generation, forever and ever.&quot; It is clear even few Mormons remember the name of Oliver Granger: <br />
&quot;And again, I say unto you, I remember my servant Oliver Granger; behold, verily I say unto him that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord.&quot;<br />
<br />
- Doctrine and Covenants 117:12<br />
<br />
On September 22 and 23, 1832, Joseph Smith foretold of an LDS temple to be built in Independence, Missouri: <br />
<br />
&quot;A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and six elders, as they united their hearts and lifted their voices on high. Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of New Jerusalem. Which city shall be built, beginning at the temple lot, which is appointed by the finger of the Lord, in the western boundaries of the State of Missouri, and dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith, Jun., and others with whom the Lord was well pleased. Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation. For verily this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
- Doctrine and Covenants 84:1-5<br />
<br />
&quot;Verily thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom in my servant David W. Patten, that he settle up all his business as soon as he possibly can, and make a disposition of his merchandise, that he may perform a mission unto me next spring, in company with others, even twelve including himself, to testify of my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world. For verily thus saith the Lord, that inasmuch as there are those among you who deny my name, others shall be planted in their stead and receive their bishopric. Amen.&quot;<br />
<br />
- Doctrine and Covenants 114:1-2<br />
<br />
&quot;Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death and misery of many souls; And the time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at this place. For behold, the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then war shall be poured out upon all nations. And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war. And it shall come to pass also that the remnants who are left of the land will marshal themselves, and shall become exceedingly angry, and shall vex the Gentiles with a sore vexation. And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth shall mourn; and with famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also, shall the inhabitants of the earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty God, until the consumption decreed hath made a full end of all nations.&quot;<br />
<br />
- Doctrine and Covenants 87:1-6<br />
<br />
Although many Mormons point to this &quot;Civil War Prophecy&quot; as proof of Joseph Smith as a prophet, many points in this revelation never happened or were incorrect. Click <a href="http://www.ils.unc.edu/~unsworth/mormon/civilwar.html">here</a><br />
<br />
And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God. <br />
<br />
- Book of Mormon, Alma 7:10<br />
<br />
&quot;False prophets-the curse and scourge of the world! How awful and awesome and evil it is when one pretends and professes to speak for God in leading men to salvation, but in fact has a message that is false, a doctrine that is not true, and a prophecy that will not come to pass!&quot; (Bruce R. McConkie, [Mormon Apostle] &quot;The Mortal Messiah&quot;, 2:168-169)<br />
&quot;If Joseph Smith was a deceiver, who wilfully attempted to mislead the people, then he should be exposed; his claims should be refuted, and his doctrines shown to be false, . . .&quot; <br />
<br />
- Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, Doctrines of Salvation, Vol. 1, p. 188-9<br />
