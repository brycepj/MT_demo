<h3>1st Message &#8211; Think for yourself:</h3><br />
&#8220;President Joseph Smith read the 14th chapter of Ezekiel &#8211; said the Lord had declared by the Prophet [Ezekiel], that the people should each stand for himself, and depend on no man or men in that state of corruption of the Jewish Church &#8211; that righteous persons could only deliver their own souls &#8211; applied it to the present state [1842] of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints &#8211; said if the people departed from the Lord, they must fall &#8211; that they were depending on the Prophet, hence were darkened in their minds, in consequence of neglecting the duties devolving upon themselves...&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>The Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, pp. 237-238<br />
<br />
&#8220;What a pity it would be, if we were led by one man to utter destruction! Are you afraid of this? I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by him. I am fearful they settle down in a state of blink self-security, trusting their eternal destiny in the hands of their leaders with a reckless confidence that in itself would thwart the purposes of God in their salvation, and weaken the influence they could give to their leaders, did they know for themselves, by the revelations of Jesus, that they are led in the right way. Let every man and woman know, themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates, or not. This has been my exhortation continually.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 9, p. 150<br />
<br />
&#8220;How easy it would be for your leaders to lead you to destruction, unless you actually know the mind and will of the spirit yourselves.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 3, p. 45<br />
<br />
&#8220;I do not wish any Latter-day Saint in this world, nor in heaven, to be satisfied with anything I do, unless the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, the spirit of revelation, makes them satisfied.... Suppose that the people were heedless, that they manifested no concern with regard to the things of the Kingdom of God, but threw the whole burden upon the leaders of the people, saying, &#8216;If the brethren who take charge of matters are satisfied, we are,' this is not pleasing in the sight of the Lord.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 3, p. 45<br />
<br />
&#8220;... Now those men, or those women, who know no more about the power of God, and the influences of the Holy Spirit, than to be led entirely by another person, suspending their own understanding, and rinning their faith upon another's sleeve, will never be capable of entering into the celestial glory, to be crowned as they anticipate; they will never be capable of becoming Gods. They cannot rule themselves, to say nothing of ruling others, but they must be dictated to do in every trifle, like a child. They cannot control themselves in the least, but James, Peter, or somebody else must control them. They never can become Gods, nor be crowned as rulers with glory, immortality, and eternal lives. They never can hold scepters of glory, majesty, and power in the Celestial Kingdom. Who will? Those who are valiant and inspired with the true independence of heaven, who will go forth boldly in the service of their God, leaving others to do as they please, determined to do right, through all mankind besides should take the opposite course. Will this apply to any of you? Your own hearts can answer.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 1, p. 312<br />
<br />
&#8220;If, after a rigid examination, it be found an imposition, it should be extensively published to the world as such; the evidences and arguments on which the imposture was detected, should be clearly and logically stated, that those who have been sincerely yet unfortunately deceived, may perceive the nature of the deception and be reclaimed, and that those who continue to publish the delusion, may be exposed and silenced....&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Orson Pratt, <em>Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon</em><br />
<br />
&#8220;... convince us of our errors of doctrine, if we have any, by reason, by logical arguments, or by the Word of God, and we will be ever grateful for the information, and you will ever have the pleasing reflection that you have been instruments in the hands of God of redeeming your fellow beings from the darkness which you may see enveloping their minds.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Orson Pratt, <em>The Seer</em>, pp. 15-16<br />
<br />
&quot;I think a full, free talk is frequently of great use; we want nothing secret nor underhanded, and I for one want no association with things that cannot be talked about and will not bear investigation.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Prophet John Taylor, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 20, p. 264<br />
<br />
&#8220;Do not, brethren, put your trust in a man though he be a bishop, an apostle, or a president. If you do, they will fail you at some time or place; they will do wrong or seem to, and your support be gone...&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle George Q. Cannon, Millennial Star, v. 53, pp. 658-659, as quoted in Gospel Truth, v. 1, p. 319<br />
<br />
&#8220;We talk of obedience, but do we require any man or woman to ignorantly obey the counsels that are given? Do the First Presidency require it? No, never.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Joseph F. Smith, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 16, p. 248<br />
<br />
&#8220;President Wilford Woodruff is a man of wisdom and experience, and we respect him, but we do not believe his personal views or utterances are revelations from God; and when &#8216;Thus saith the Lord,' comes from him, the saints investigate it: they do not shut their eyes and take it down like a pill.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Charles W. Penrose, <em>Millennial Star</em>, v. 54, p. 191<br />
<br />
&#8220;And none are required to tamely and blindly submit to a man because he has a portion of the priesthood. We have heard men who hold the priesthood remark, that they would do anything they were told to do by those who presided over them, if they knew it was wrong; but such obedience as this is worse than folly to us; it is slavery in the extreme; and the man who would thus willingly degrade himself should not claim a rank among intelligent beings, until he turns from his folly. A man of God... would spite the idea. Others, in the extreme exercise of their almighty authority have taught that such obedience was necessary, and that no matter what the saints were told to do by their presidents, they should do it without asking any questions. When Elders of Israel will so far indulge in these extreme notions of obedience as to teach them to people, it is generally because they have it in their minds to do wrong themselves.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Charles W. Penrose, <em>Millennial Star</em>, v. 14, no. 38, pp. 593-595<br />
<br />
&#8220;If a faith will not bear to be investigated, if its preachers and professors are afraid to have it examined; their foundation must be very weak.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle George A. Smith, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 14, p. 216<br />
<br />
&#8220;We should be scientific &#8211; that is, open-minded, approaching new problems without prejudice, deferring a decision until all the facts are in.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Hugh B. Brown, &#8220;A Final Testimony,&#8221; from An Abundant Life, 1999<br />
<br />
&#8220;There are altogether too many people in the world who are willing to accept as true whatever is printed in a book or delivered from a pulpit.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Hugh B. Brown, &#8220;A Final Testimony,&#8221; from An Abundant Life, 1999<br />
<br />
&#8220;I admire men and women who have developed the questing spirit, who are unafraid of new ideas as stepping stones to progress. We should, of course, respect the opinions of others, but we should also be unafraid to dissent &#8211; if we are informed. Thoughts and expressions compete in the marketplace of thought, and in that competition truth emerges triumphant. Only error fears freedom of expression.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Hugh B. Brown, &#8220;A Final Testimony,&#8221; from An Abundant Life, 1999<br />
<br />
&#8220;The church is not so much concerned with whether the thoughts of its members are orthodox or heterodox as it is that they shall have thoughts. One may memorize much without learning anything....<br />
&#8220;And while all members should respect, support, and heed the teachings of the authorities of the church, no one should accept a statement and base his or her testimony upon it, no matter who makes it, until he or she has, under mature examination, found it to be true and worthwhile...&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Hugh B. Brown, &#8220;A Final Testimony,&#8221; from An Abundant Life, 1999<br />
<br />
&#8220;... the question is sometimes asked &#8211; to what extent is obedience to those who hold the Priesthood required? This is a very important question, and one which should be understood by all Saints. In attempting to answer this question, we would repeat, in short, what we have already written, that willing obedience to the laws of God, administered by the Priesthood, is indispensable to salvation; but we would further add, that a proper conservative to this power exists for the benefit of all, and none are required to tamely and blindly submit to a man because he has a portion of the Priesthood.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Millennial Star</em>, &#8220;Priesthood,&#8221; 1852<br />
<br />
&#8220;We have heard men who hold the Priesthood remark, that they would do any thing they were told to do by those who presided over them, if they knew it was wrong: but such obedience as this is worse than folly to us; it is slavery in the extreme; and the man who would thus willingly degrade himself, should not claim a rank among intelligent beings, unless he turns from his folly.<br />
&#8220;When the Elders of Israel will so far indulge in these extreme notions of obedience, as to teach them to the people, it is generally because they have it in their hearts to do wrong themselves, and wish to pave the way to accomplish that wrong; or else because they have done wrong, and wish to use the cloak of their authority to cover it.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Millennial Star</em>, &#8220;Priesthood,&#8221; 1852<br />
<br />
<h3>2nd Message &#8211; Do what we say:</h3><br /><br />
<br />
&#8220;No member of the Church has the right to publish any doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, without first submitting them for examination and approval to the First Presidency and the Twelve. There is but one man upon the earth, at one time, who holds the keys to receive revelations for the Church, and who has the authority to write doctrines by way of commandment unto the Church.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Messages of the First Presidency</em>, v. 2, p. 239<br />
<br />
&quot;Any Latter-day Saint who denounces or opposes whether actively or otherwise, any pan or doctrine advocated by the prophets, seers, revelators of the church, is cultivating the spirit of apostasy. One cannot speak evil of the lord's anointed... and retain the holy spirit in his heart. This sort of game is Satan's favorite pastime, and he has practiced it to believing souls since Adam. He {Satan} wins a great victory when he can get members of the church to speak against their leaders and to do their own thinking.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Ward Teachers Message, <em>Deseret News</em>, Church Section, p.5, May 26, 1945 <br />
<br />
When our leaders speak, the thinking has been done. When they propose a plan- it is God's Plan. When they point the way, there is no other which is safe. When they give directions, it should mark the end of controversy, God works in no other way. To think otherwise, without immediate repentance, may cost on e his faith, may destroy his testimony, and leave him a stranger to the kingdom of God.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Ward Teachers Message, <em>Deseret News</em>, Church Section p. 5, May 26, 1945 <br />
<br />
&#8220;We have the responsibility to preserve the doctrinal purity of the Church. We are united in this objective.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve statement, <em>Sunstone</em>, 16:6, no. 92, November 1993, p. 72; <a href="http://www.mormonismi.net/artikkelit/puhdistus1993.shtml">http://www.mormonismi.net/artikkelit/puhdistus1993.shtml</a><br />
<br />
&#8220;My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church, and if he tells you to do something wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Heber J. Grant, as quoted by Apostle Marion G. Romney in &#8220;The Covenant of the Priesthood,&#8221; <em>Ensign</em>, July 1972, p. 98<br />
<br />
&#8220;Any Latter-day Saint who denounces or opposes whether actively or otherwise, any plan or doctrine advocated by the prophets, seers, revelators of the church, is cultivating the spirit of apostasy. One cannot speak evil of the Lord's anointed... and retain the holy spirit in his heart. This sort of game is Satan's favorite pastime, and he has practiced it to believing souls since Adam. He [Satan] wins a great victory when he can get members of the church to speak against their leaders and to do their own thinking.<br />

<br />
- Ward Teacher's Message, <em>Deseret News</em>, Church Section, p. 5, May 26, 1945; see also <em>Improvement Era</em>, June 1945<br />
<br />
&#8220;Always keep your eye on the President of the church, and if he ever tells you to do anything, even if it is wrong, and you do it, the lord will bless you for it, but you don't need to worry. The lord will never let his mouthpiece lead the people astray.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Marion G. Romney, <em>Conference Report</em>, Oct. 1960, p. 78<br />
<br />
&#8220;When the Prophet speaks the debate is over.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle N. Eldon Tanner, <em>Ensign</em>, Aug. 1979, pp. 2-3.<br />
<br />
&#8220;The Lord Almighty leads this Church, and he will never suffer you to be led astray if you are found doing your duty. You may go home and sleep as sweetly as a babe in its mother's arms, as to any danger of your leaders leading you astray, for if they should try to do so the Lord would quickly sweep them from the earth.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 9, p. 289<br />
<br />
&#8220;No true Latter-day Saint will ever take a stand that is in opposition to what the Lord has revealed to those who direct the affairs of his earthly kingdom. No Latter-day Saint who is true and faithful in all things will ever pursue a course, or espouse a cause, or publish an article or book that weakens or destroys faith.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, <em>Conference Report</em>, October 1984, p. 104<br />
<br />
&#8220;Follow your leaders who have been duly ordained and have been publicly sustained, and you will not be led astray.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Boyd K. Packer, General Conference, Oct. 1992, as quoted in Ensign, Nov. 1992<br />
<br />
&#8220;There are three areas where members of the Church, influenced by social and political unrest, are being caught up and led away. I chose these three because they have made major invasions into the membership of the Church. In each, the temptation is for us to turn about and face the wrong way, and it is hard to resist, for doing it seems reasonable and right.<br />
&#8220;The dangers I speak of come from the gay-lesbian movement, the feminist movement (both of which are relatively new), and the ever-present challenge from the so-called scholars or intellectuals. Our local leaders must deal with all three of them with ever increasingly frequency. In each case, the members who are hurting have the conviction that the Church somehow is doing something wrong to members or that the Church is not doing enough for them.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Boyd K. Packer, &#8220;Talk to the All-Church Coordinating Council,&#8221; May 18, 1993<br />
<br />
&#8220;There is no such thing as an accurate, objective history of the Church without consideration of the spiritual powers that attend this work... There is a temptation... to want to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith-promoting or not. Some things that are true are not very useful... In an effort to be objective, impartial, and scholarly, a writer or a teacher may unwittingly be giving equal time to the adversary... In the Church we are not neutral. We are one-sided. There is a war going on, and we are engaged in it... The fact that something is already in print or available from another source is no excuse for using potentially damaging materials in writing, speaking, or teaching: &#8216;Do not spread disease germs!'&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Boyd K. Packer, &quot;The Mantle is Far, Far Greater Than the Intellect,&quot; speech delivered at the 1981 Church Educational System Religious Educators' Symposium<br />
<br />
&#8220;[Church history] if not properly written or properly taught,... may be a faith destroyer... The writer or teacher who has an exaggerated loyalty to the theory that everything must be told is laying a foundation for his own judgment.... The Lord made it very clear that some things are to be taught selectively and some things are to be given only to those who are worthy.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Boyd K. Packer, &#8220;The Mantle is Far, Far Greater Than the Intellect,&#8221; reprinted in <em>BYU Studies</em>, v. 21, no. 3, 1981, pp. 259-277<br />
<br />
&#8220;Some things that are true are not edifying or appropriate to communicate. Readers of history and biography should ponder that moral reality as part of their effort to understand the significance of what they read.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Dallin H. Oaks, &#8220;Reading Church History,&#8221; Ninth Annual Church Educational System Religious Educators' Symposium, August 16, 1985, Brigham Young University<br />
<br />
&#8220;Satan can even use truth to promote his purposes. Facts, severed from their context, can convey an erroneous impression.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle Dallin H. Oaks, &#8220;Reading Church History,&#8221; speech delivered at the Ninth Annual Church Educational System Religious Educators' Symposium, BYU, August 16, 1985<br />
<br />
&#8220;Those men and women who persist in publicly challenging basic doctrines, practices, and establishment of the Church sever themselves from the Spirit of the Lord and forfeit their right to place and influence in the Church.... There is a certain arrogance in thinking that any of us may be more spiritually intelligent, more learned, or more righteous than the Councils called to preside over us.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Apostle James E. Faust, &#8220;Keeping Covenants and Honoring the Priesthood,&#8221; <em>Sunstone</em>, 16:6, no. 92, November 1993, p. 72<br />
<br />
&#8220;I think the Lord had them [apostates or critics] in mind when he declared: &#8216;Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord.' &#8230; they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Gordon B. Hinckley, &#8220;Prophet Pre-eminently Grateful for Testimony,&#8221; <em>Church News</em>, April 8, 2000<br />
<br />
&#8220;Do not be trapped by the sophistry of the world that for the most part is negative and that seldom, if ever, bears good fruit. Do not be ensnared by those clever ones whose self-appointed mission it is to demean that which is sacred, to emphasize human weakness rather than inspired strength, and to undermine faith.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Gordon B. Hinckley, &#8220; &#8216;Stop Looking for Storms and Enjoy the Sunlight,'&#8221; <em>Church News</em>, July 3, 1983, p. 11<br />
<br />
&#8220;[Apostle LeGrand Richards] told me to quit studying materials put out by the [anti-Mormon] Tanner's... I told him &#8216;surely some day there will be an answer to these questions.' He told me there never would be an answer and I should stop my inquiries.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Letter to Sandra and Jerald Tanner, authors of &#8220;anti-Mormon&#8221; literature, letter dated Aug. 13, 1978<br />
<br />
&#8220;There are the so-called &#8216;learned' that have let their intellect undermine their spiritual moorings and who would also attempt to lead the faithful away from those who are appointed by the Lord to lead. There are those who feel that our leaders are out of touch with the realities of the day. They would attempt to lead members by substituting their own knowledge for the revelations from God to His prophets. And, unfortunately, there are those who would so follow. Christ warned, &#8216;Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.'&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Bishop Richard C. Edgley or the Presiding Bishopric, General Conference, April 1993<br />
<br />
&#8220;There are limits to Mormon sociability. In 1993 the church capped a harsh campaign of intellectual purification against dozens of feminists and dissidents with the excommunication of D. Michael Quinn, a leading historian whose painstaking work documented Smith's involvement with the occult and church leader's misrepresentation of some continued polygamy in the early 1900's.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Time</em>, Aug. 4, 1997<br />
<br />
&#8220;The religion does allow individuals to hold differing interpretations of the Book of Mormon. But once you begin to publish and your interpretation differs from not only the Book of Mormon but doctrinal positions generally, then you are flirting with disfellowshipment, or apostasy.&quot;<br />
<br />
- Jan Shipps, as quoted in &quot;Mormon Dissidents Rally Behind Scholar,&quot; by Janet I Tu, <em>Seattle Times</em>, December 7, 2002<br />
<br />
&#8220;Eugene England and Lowell Bennion were not permitted to publish with Deseret Book or Bookcraft by direct intervention of two members of the Twelve. Carol Lynn Pearson was blacklisted from church publications until she was able &#8216;through prayers and tears' to get one of the Twelve to reverse the decision. Jim Allen was viewed with suspicion because of the Story of the Latter-day Saints. The Church News could not review Building the City of God or any other book by our History Division employees without specific clearance from the Twelve. Claudia Bushman and Scott Kenney could not be published or mentioned because of their connection with Exponent II and Sunstone. Several Mormon intellectuals were publishing under pseudonyms.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- LDS Historian Leonard Arrington, <em>Adventures of a Church Historian</em>, p. 154<br />
<br />
&#8220;If you visit the East Wing of the Church Office Building you will find in the hallway a gallery of portraits. These are the Church Historians, from Oliver Cowdery to G. Homer Durham. But where is Leonard Arrington? Nowhere to be seen. The official explanation is that to be a Church Historian one has to be a General Authority. A brief period of our history, awkwardly embarrassing to someone, is thus erased. Orwell's Truthspeak did not have to wait for 1984.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- David Bitton, LDS Historian, &#8220;Ten Years in Camelot: A Personal Memoir,&#8221; <em>Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought</em>, v. 16, no. 3, Fall 1983, p. 19<br />
<br />
<em>&#8220;September Six&#8221; excommunications:</em><br />
<br />
&#8220;Lavina Fielding Anderson was excommunicated and has lived ever since in Mormon limbo.... Anderson was never informed exactly what her 1993 &#8216;apostasy' consisted of. But everyone knows that she is being punished for delivering a paper... that compiled data on more than one hundred examples of church repression against intellectuals...<br />
&#8220;Avraham Gileadi, an independent scriptural scholar, was excommunicated two years after the publication of his technical tome on the Second Coming, The Last Days: Types and Shadows from the Bible and the Book of Mormon. Oddly, Gileadi is a conservative; his book avoids the kookiness associated with some of Protestant millennialists; and it was vetted and issued by the church's own Deseret Book Company. Moreover, he had complied when directed to stop promoting his views. The church has never clarified which of Gileadi's opinions might be heretical...<br />
&#8220;Maxine Hanks is a writer and frequent speaker on feminist topics who was excommunicated for urging that the LDS Priesthood be opened to women. Another presumed provocation was her editing of a 1992 Signature Books anthology, Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism, in which contributors discuss female priesthood and another of the hierarchy's least favorite topics, adoration of Mormonism's Mother in Heaven...<br />
&#8220;Lynn Kanavel Whitesides, then president of the Mormon Women's Forum, was similarly chastised for her public discussion about women's priesthood and the Mother in Heaven...<br />
&#8220;Paul Toscano, a Salt Lake City attorney, was a founder of the Mormon Alliance and longtime critic of the church leadership...<br />
&#8220;D. Michael Quinn, the most important scholar among the Six and a resigned Brigham Young University historian, wrote a 1985 Dialogue article on church leaders' secret involvement in polygamy after the 1890 Manifesto, and the 1987 Signature book Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, which raised questions about the spiritual roots of Joseph Smith's religion.&#8221;<br />

<br />
<em>Other recent excommunications:</em><br />
<br />
&#8220;David P. Wright is the Hebrew scripture specialist who had been fired by BYU in 1988 for believing the Book of Mormon was a nineteenth-century writing of Joseph Smith... <br />
&#8220;Brent Metcalfe, and independent researcher, was expelled for editing the New Approaches anthology...<br />
&#8220;Michael Barrett, a lawyer for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington, was convicted of apostasy for refusing to obey church orders and stop sending controversial letters to the editors of newspapers. Barrett's letters contained facts about Mormonism's differences with mainstream Christian doctrine and such embarrassing topics as the black priesthood ban, polygamy, and Adam-as-God.<br />
&#8220;Janice Allred, a freelance writer and feminist, was convicted over a 1992 Sunstone Symposium paper, &#8220;Toward a Mormon Theology of God the Mother...&#8221;<br />

<br />
&#8220;The Church warns its members against symposia and other similar gatherings that include presentations that (1) disparage, ridicule, make light of, or are otherwise inappropriate in their treatment of sacred matters or (2) could injure the Church, detract from its mission, or jeopardize its members' well-being. Members should not allow their position or standing in the Church to be used to promote or imply endorsement of such gatherings.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>General Handbook of Instructions</em>, 1999<br />
<br />
&#8220;I have come to feel increasingly marginal to the Mormon community during my adult life, at least in a social and intellectual sense, despite my continuing and conscientious participation in church activity (including leadership) and despite my own deep personal faith in the religion itself.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Armand L. Mauss, <em>The Angel and the Beehive</em>, pp. xii-xiii<br />
<br />
&quot;All good LDS, including scholars, must accept the judgment of the Church's General Authorities. If it is what the brethren want, then good LDS must say it is appropriate. This may be difficult for scholars, but obedience is an important concept of the Mormon Church.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- &#8220;Mormon Brethren Silencing Scholars?,&#8221; <em>Salt Lake Tribune</em>, May 26, 1983, p. B4<br />
<br />
&#8220;When Elder Packer interviewed me as a prospective member of Brigham Young University's faculty in 1976, he explained: &#8216;I have a hard time with historians because they idolize the truth. The truth is not uplifting; it destroys. I could tell most of the secretaries in the church office building because that they are ugly and fat. That would be the truth, but it would hurt and destroy them. Historians should tell only that part of the truth that is inspiring and uplifting.'&#8221;<br />

<br />
&#8220;All fingers seem to point to Elder Boyd Packer, acting president of the twelve apostles, as the prime force behind what has been called the &#8216;Mormon Inquisition.' While Elder Packer, nicknamed &#8216;Darth Packer' by the irreverent because of his cold and detached personal style, is a far cry from Torquemada&#8230; his speeches, instructions to lower ranking authorities, and direct contacts with local leaders have shown him to be the prime orchestrator of top-level-organized punishment.&#8221;<br />

<br />
&#8220;The church wants to portray this image of being unified in all it does&#8230;. It wants Mormons to be unquestioning&#8230;. I worked in public affairs for the church for 13 years, and I had to lie all the time, and this has really battered my faith.&#8221;<br />

<br />
&#8220;Every scholar with whom I am acquainted agrees that there is yet official Church reticence when it comes to using certain records, diaries, and other materials in the church's archives and in the First Presidency's possession relating to polygamy.&#8221;<br />
