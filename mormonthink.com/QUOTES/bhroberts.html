Check out Roberts' book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1560850272/qid=1091914132/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-3960798-7723963?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Studies of the Book of Mormon</a><br />
<br />
B.H. Roberts was one of the most respected and well-known LDS Historians. He also was a member of the First Council of Seventy (1888-1933). Roberts' in-depth studies of Book of Mormon origins led him to doubt the authenticity of the book. Roberts' honest research and study is uncommon to LDS Historians, who commonly seek to suppress and sanitize LDS-sanctioned historical information rather than critically analyze Mormon origins.<br />
<br />
&#8220;One other subject remains to be considered in this division... viz. &#8211; was Joseph Smith possessed of a sufficiently vivid and creative imagination as to produce such a work as the Book of Mormon from such materials as have been indicated in the proceeding chapters... That such power of imagination would have to be of a high order is conceded; that Joseph Smith possessed such a gift of mind there can be no question....<br />
&#8220;In light of this evidence, there can be no doubt as to the possession of a vividly strong, creative imagination by Joseph Smith, the Prophet, an imagination, it could with reason be urged, which, given the suggestions that are found in the &#8216;common knowledge' of accepted American antiquities of the times, supplemented by such a work as Ethan Smith's View of the Hebrews [published in Palmyra in 1825], it would make it possible for him to create a book such as the Book of Mormon is.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Studies of the Book of Mormon</em>, by B.H. Roberts, p. 243, 250<br />
<br />
&#8220;There were other Anti-Christs among the Nephites, but they were more military leaders than religious innovators... they are all of one breed and brand; so nearly alike that one mind is the author of them, and that a young and underdeveloped, but piously inclined mind. The evidence I sorrowfully submit, points to Joseph Smith as their creator. It is difficult to believe that they are a product of history, that they came upon the scene separated by long periods of time, and among a race which was the ancestral race of the red man of America.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Studies of the Book of Mormon</em>, by B.H. Roberts, p. 271<br />
<br />
&#8220;If from all that has gone before in Part 1, the view be taken that the Book of Mormon is merely of human origin... if it be assumed that he is the author of it, then it could be said there is much internal evidence in the book itself to sustain such a view.<br />
&#8220;In the first place there is a certain lack of perspective in the things the book relates as history that points quite clearly to an underdeveloped mind as their origin. The narrative proceeds in characteristic disregard of conditions necessary to its reasonableness, as if it were a tale told by a child, with utter disregard for consistency.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Studies of the Book of Mormon</em>, by B.H. Roberts, p. 251<br />
<br />
&#8220;At his [B.H. Robert's] request Pres. Grant called a meeting of the Twelve Apostles and Bro. Roberts presented the matter, told them frankly that he was stumped and ask[ed] for their aide [sic] in the explanation. In answer, they merely one by one stood up and bore testimony to the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. George Albert Smith in tears testified that his faith in the Book had not been shaken by the question.... No answer was available. Bro[.] Roberts could not criticize them for not being able to answer it or to assist him, but said that in a church which claimed continuous revelation, a crisis had arisen where revelation was necessary. After the meeting he wrote Pres. Grant expressing his disappointment at the failure... It was mentioned at the meeting by Bro. Roberts that there were other Book of Mormon problems that needed special attention. <br />
&#8220;Richard Lyman spoke up and ask[ed] if there were things that would help our prestige and when Bro. Roberts answered no, he said then why discuss them. This attitude was too much for the historically minded Roberts...<br />
&#8220;After this Bro. Roberts made a special Book of Mormon study; treated the problem systematically and historically and in a 400 type written page thesis set forth a revolutionary article on the origin of the Book of Mormon and sent it to Pres. Grant. It's an article far too strong for the average Church member but for the intellectual group he considers it a contribution to assist in explaining Mormonism.<br />
&#8220;He swings to a psychological explanation of the Book of Mormon and shows that the plates were not objective but subjective with Joseph Smith, that his exceptional imagination qualified him psychologically for the experience which he had in presenting to the world the Book of Mormon and that the plates with the Urim and Thummim were not objective. <br />
&#8220;He explained certain literary difficulties in the Book....<br />
&#8220;These are some of the things which has made Bro. Roberts shift his base on the Book of Mormon. Instead of regarding it as the strongest evidence we have of Church Divinity, he regards it as the one which needs the most bolstering. His greatest claim for the divinity of the Prophet Joseph Smith lies in the Doctrine and Covenants.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Private Journal of Wesley P. Lloyd</em>, Aug. 7, 1933<br />
<br />
&#8220;... B.H. Roberts, a seventy, had problems directly involved with the writings of Church history. In November 1910, Church President Joseph F. Smith told the Salt Lake Temple fast meeting that Elder Roberts doubted that Joseph had actually received a priesthood restoration from John the Baptist. Church president Heber J. Grant also required B.H. Roberts to censor some documents in the seventh volume of the History of the Church. Elder Roberts was furious. &#8216;I desire, however to take this occasion of disclaiming any responsibility for the mutilating of that very important part of President young's manuscript,' Roberts replied to President Grant in August 1932, &#8216;and also to say, that while you had the physical power of eliminating that passage from the History, I do not believe you had any moral right to do so.'&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Dr. Michael Quinn, Mormon scholar, <em>Sunstone</em>, February 1992, pp. 13-14 <br />
