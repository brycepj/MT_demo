<p><strong>Martin Harris (1783 - 1875), one of the Three Witnesses:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joseph had a stone which was dug from the well of Mason Chase, twenty-four feet from the surface. In this stone he could see many things to my certain knowledge. It was by means of this stone he first discovered these plates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consequently long before the idea of a Golden Bible entered their minds, in their excursions for money-digging, which I believe usually occurred in the night, that they might conceal from others the knowledge of the place, where they struck their treasures, Jo used to be usually their guide, putting into a hat a peculiar stone he had through which he looked to decide where they should begin to dig. It was after one of these night excursions, that Jo, while he lay upon his bed, had a remarkable dream. An angel of God seemed to approach him, clad in celestial splendor.</p>

<p class="refsource">Martin Harris, as reported in <a href="https://archive.org/stream/bywaygleanings00clarrich#page/225/mode/1up"><em>Gleanings by the Way</em></a>, by John A. Clark, 1840, Chapter XXII, p. 225.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a company there in the neighborhood, who were digging for money supposed to have been hidden by the ancients. Of this company were old Mr. Stowell &#8211; I think his name was Josiah &#8211; also old Mr. Beman, also Samuel Lawrence, George Proper, Joseph Smith, jr., and his father, and his brother Hiram Smith. They dug for money in Palmyra, Manchester, also in Pennsylvania, and other places&#8230; and they took Joseph to look in the stone for them, and he did so for a while, and he then told them the enchantment was so strong that he could not see, and they gave it up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the sanction of David Whitmer, and by his authority, I now state that he does not say that Joseph Smith ever translated in his presence by aid of Urim and Thummim, but by means of one dark colored, opaque stone called a &#8216;Seer Stone,&#8217; which was placed in the crown of a hat, into which Joseph would put his face, so as to exclude the external light. Then, a spiritual light would shine forth, and parchment would appear before Joseph, upon which was a line of characters from the plates, and under it, the translation in English; at least, so Joseph said.</p>

<p><strong>David Whitmer (1805 - 1888), one of the Three Witnesses:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will now give you a description of the manner in which the Book of Mormon was translated. Joseph would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine.</p>

<p><strong>Prophet Brigham Young (1801 - 1877):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These treasures that are in the earth are carefully watched, they can be removed from place to place according to the good pleasure of Him who made them and owns them. He has his messengers at his service, and it is just as easy for an angel to remove the minerals from any part of these mountains to another, as it is for you and me to walk up and down this hall. I relate this because it is marvelous to you. But to those who understand these things, it is not marvelous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="refsource">Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 19, pp. 37-38</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seer stone which Joseph Smith first obtained He got in an Iron kettle 25 feet under ground. He saw it while looking in another seers stone which a person had. He went right to the spot &amp; dug &amp; found it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="refsource">Prophet Brigham Young, in <em>Wilford Woodruff&#8217;s Journal, 1833-1898 Typescript</em>, 9 vols., ed. by Scott G. Kenney, v. 5, September 11, 1859, pp. 382-383</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten years ago, it was called heresy for Joseph Smith to be a money digger, and receive revelations; it actually became treason; and the people killed him for it: and now I see hundreds of reverend gentlemen going to dig money. I despise a man who won&#8217;t dig for gold, he is a lazy man, and intends to spunge on others. Do not think that I blame you; all I have to say is, that you have to follow in the wake of &#8216;Old Joe Smith,&#8217; and paddle away to dig gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="refsource">Prophet Brigham Young, June 23, 1850, <em>Deseret News</em>, June 29, 1850, p. 20</p>

<p><strong>Prophet Wilford Woodruff (1807 - 1898):</strong></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p class="refsource">Prophet Wilford Woodruff, in Kenny, <em>Wilford Woodruff&#8217;s Journal</em>, v. 8, May 18, 1888, p. 500</p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Woodruff [remarked] in relation to the seer stone known as &#8216;Gazalem,&#8217; which was shown of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph to be some thirty feet under ground, and which he obtained by digging under the pretense of excavating for a well, as related in his own history. This remarkable stone was used by the Prophet.</p>

<p><strong>Others:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>His (Joseph&#8217;s) occupation was that of seeing, or pretending to see by means of a stone placed in his hat, and his hat closed over his face. In this way he pretended to discover minerals and hidden treasures&#8230;. The manner in which he pretended to read and interpret, was the same as when he looked for the money-diggers, with the stone in his hat, and his hat over his face, while the Book of Plates were at the same time hid in the woods!</p>

<p class="refsource">Isaac Hale affidavit, Joseph Smith, Jr.'s father-in-law, in <em>Susquehanna Register</em>, May 1, 1834</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to our recollection, the starting point of the money digging speculation in our vicinity in which Joseph Smith, jr. was engaged was as follows&#8230;. a man by the name of Wm. Hale, a distant relative of our uncle Isaac Hale, came to Isaac Hale and said that he had been informed by a woman named Odle, who claimed to possess the power of seeing under ground, such persons were then commonly called peepers, that there was great treasure concealed in the hill north-east from his, Isaac Hale&#8217;s house. By her directions, Wm. Hale commences digging, but being too lazy to work, and too poor to hire, he obtained a partner by the name of Oliver Harper, of [New] York state, who had the means to hire help. But after a short time, operations were suspended for a time: during the suspension, Wm. Hale heard of peeper Joseph Smith, jr., wrote to him, and soon visited him; he found Smith&#8217;s representations were so flattering that Smith was either hired or became a partner with Wm. Hale, Oliver Harper, and a man by the name of Stowell, who had some property.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we arrived at Mr. Hale&#8217;s, in Harmony, P.A. from which place he [Joseph] had taken his wife, a scene presented itself, truly affecting. His father-in-law (Mr. Hale) addressed Joseph, in a flood of tears: &#8216;You have stolen my daughter and married her. I had much rather have followed her to her grave. You spend your time in digging for money &#8211; pretended to see in a stone, and thus try to deceive people.&#8217; Joseph wept, and acknowledged he could not see in a stone now, nor never could; and that his former pretensions in that respect, were all false. He then promised to give up his old habits of digging for money and looking into stones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="refsource">Peter Ingersoll, Affidavit, as quoted in <em>Mormonism Unveiled</em>, by E.D. Howe, pp. 234-235</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They [the Smith&#8217;s] lived, at that time, in Palmyra, about one mile and a half from my residence. A great part of their time was devoted to digging for money: especially in the night time, when they said the money could be most easily obtained&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joseph Smith, Sen., came to me one night, and told me, that Joseph Jr. had been looking in his glass, and had seen, not many rods from his house, two or three kegs of gold and silver, some feet under the surface of the earth; and that none others but the elder Joseph and myself could get them. I accordingly consented to go, and early in the evening repaired to the place of deposit. Joseph, Sen. first made a circle, twelve or fourteen feet in diameter. This circle, said he, contains the treasure. He then struck in the ground a row of witch hazel sticks, around the said circle, for the purpose of keeping off the evil spirits. Within this circle he made another, of about eight or ten feet in diameter. He walked around three times on the periphery of this last circle, muttering to himself something which I could not understand. He next struck a steel rod in the centre of the circles, and then enjoined profound silence upon us, lest we should arouse the evil spirit who had the charge of these treasures. After we had dug a trench about five feet in depth around the rod, the old man by signs and motions, asked leave of absence, and went to the house to inquire of young Joseph the cause of our disappointment. He soon returned and said, that Joseph had remained all this time in the house, looking in his stone and watching the motions of the evil spirit &#8211; that he saw the spirit come up to the ring and as soon as it beheld the cone which we had formed around the rod, it caused the money to sink. We then went into the house, and the old man observed, that we had made a mistake in the commencement of the operation; if it had not been for that, we should have got the money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She [Sally Chase, glass-looker] told me several times that young Jo Smith, who became the Mormon prophet, often came to inquire of her where to dig for treasures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="refsource">Mrs. S.F. Aderick affidavit, 1887, <em>Joseph Smith&#8217;s New York Reputation Reexamined</em>, by Roger Anderson, p. 153</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was much digging for money on our farm and about the neighborhood. I saw Uncle John and Cousin Joshua Stafford dig a hole twenty feet long, eight broad and seven deep.

<p>September 23, 1899</p>
<p>&#8230;The next morning (Sept. 23, 1899) Brother Carleton came out of his room with a coin in his hand and told me that he had plowed it up in his field on the banks of the St. Mary's River. He also told me that he had felt impressed during the night to give the coin to me although he had refused the Elder who had baptized him. "I looked at the coin as he handed it to me and I thought that I knew what it was, as I had seen a picture of Nephite coins on the fly leaf of the old edition of the Book of Mormon. The coin bore a striking resemblance to those coins.".I told him I had made up my mind to take it to the First Presidency of the Church.On the way home between Pueblo, Colorado and Salt Lake City, the first morning out, there was on the train an historian and writer from England by the name of Willis.He then said to me, ".I will place seven thousand dollars ($7000) in the bank to your credit.I thanked him for his interest but repeated that the coin was not for sale.In the office of the First Presidency there were President Lorenzo Snow, President Joseph F. Smith, President Francis M. Lyman and _________. After reporting my mission, I took the coin out and showed it to them. President Lyman went and got the old edition (probably the first edition) of the Book of Mormon in which pictures of nephite coins were printed, and found the same coin immediately.</p>
<p>Description of the Nephite Coin</p>
<p>The Egyptian characters were identically the same as those on one of the pictures in the Book of Mormon. The coin had not tarnished and the characters looked as if they had been stamped. The coin was about the size of a five-dollar gold piece, eight cornered and about as thick again as common tin, it was stamped on both sides, the characters running around the outside. The characters were small, somewhat like script or cursive writing, more like the hieratic than the hieroglyphic form. As I have said before, they were identical with the characters pictured on the Nephite coin in the old edition of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>I was asked what I intended doing with the coin and I turned to President Snow and told him that I was making him a present of the coin; that President Rich had told me that that was the proper thing to do and that I was following his instructions.</p>
<p>President Snow put his arm around my shoulder and said, "brother Robinson, you have been faithful and have kept the pledge."</p>
<p>He then went and got the money purse or leather bag that President Brigham Young had brought to the Rocky Mountains with him, also the Seer Stone and said, "This is the Seer Stone that the Prophet Joseph Smith used. There are very few worthy to view this, but you are." HE handed the Seer Stone to me and I couldn't express the joy that came to me as I took that stone in my hands. Words are not equal to the task of expressing such a sublime joy." He then told me to hand the seers stone to my wife and I handed it to her. He then blessed us with the greatest blessing I have ever heard fall from the mouth of man."</p>
<p>Description of the Seer Stone </p>
<p>The Seer Stone was the shape of an egg though not quite so large, of a gray cast something like granite but with white stripes running round it. It was transparent but had no holes, neither in the end or in the sides.</p>

<p>I had seen him two or three times, while visiting at my sister&#8217;s, but did not think it worth my while to take any notice of him. I never spoke to him, for he was a total stranger to me. However, I thought him odd looking and queer. He also told his friends that he could see money in pots, under the ground. He pretended to foretell people&#8217;s future destiny, and, according to his prognostication, his friends agreed to suspend their avocations and dig for the treasures, which were hidden in the earth; a great share of which, he said, was on Joseph Knight&#8217;s farm&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8230; in the time of their digging for money and not finding it attainable, Joe Smith told them there was a charm on the pots of money, and if some animal was killed and the blood sprinkled around the place, then they could get it. So they killed a dog, and tried this method of obtaining the precious metal; but again money was scarce in those diggings. Still, they dug and dug, but never came to the precious treasure. Alas! how vivid was the expectation when the blood of poor Tray was used to take off the charm, and after all to find their mistake.</p>

<p>In imitation of the true order of heaven whereby seers receive revelations from God through a Urim and Thummim, the devil gives his own revelations to some of his followers through peep stones or crystal balls. An instance of this copying of the true order occurred in the early days of this dispensation. Hiram Page had such a stone and was professing to have revelations for the upbuilding of Zion and the governing of the Church. Oliver Cowdery and some others were wrongly influenced thereby in consequence of which Oliver was commanded by revelation: 'Thou shalt take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me, and that Satan deceiveth him.'
