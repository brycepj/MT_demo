<br />
&quot;It is the personal opinion of the writer that the Lord does not intend that the Book of Mormon, at least at the present time, shall be proved true by any archaeological findings. They day may come when such will be the case, but not now. The Book of Mormon is itself a witness of the truth, and the promise has been given most solemnly that any person who will read it with a prayerful heart may receive the abiding testimony of its truth.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Prophet Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions, 1998, v. 2, p. 196<br />
<br />
&#8220;... our testimony of the Book of Mormon remain[s] a matter of faith, and [is] not based upon external proofs found from archaeology.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Duane R. Aston, Return to Cumorah, 1998<br />
<br />
&#8220;So far as is known to the writer, no non-Mormon archaeologist at the present time is using the Book of Mormon as a guide in archaeological research. Nor does he know of any non-Mormon archaeologist who holds that the American Indians are descendants of the Jews, or that Christianity was known in America in the first century of our era...&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Ulster Archaeological Society Newsletter</em>, no. 64, Jan. 30, 1960, p. 3<br />
<br />
&#8220;We conclude, therefore, that the Book of Mormon remains completely unverified by archaeology. The claims Mormon missionaries have made are fallacious and misleading.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Archaeology and the Book of Mormon</em>, pamphlet by Hal Hougey, p. 4-6, 1976<br />
<br />
&quot;With the exception of Latter-day Saint archaeologists, members of the archaeological profession do not, and never have, espoused the Book of Mormon in any sense of which I am aware. Non-Mormon archaeologists do not allow the Book of Mormon any place whatever in their reconstruction of the early history of the New World.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>Ulster Archaeological Society Newsletter</em>, no. 64, Jan. 30, 1960, p.3<br />
<br />
&#8220;It is not necessary here to repeat the passages in the Book of Mormon which describe such civilization.... It is only needful to show that nothing could be wider from the truth, unless all ancient American history is a lie, and its ten thousand relics tell false tales. <br />
&#8220;It may be stated in a general way that there never has been a time upon this western hemisphere within the historic period, or within three thousand years past when a uniform civilization of ANY KIND prevailed over both continents.<br />
&#8220;We are to learn now:<br />
1st. That a Christian civilization has never existed in Central America, not even for a day.<br />
2nd. The people of Central America, as far back as their record has been traced (and that is centuries earlier than the alleged beginning of Nephite history), have always been an idolatrous people.... The entire civilization of the Book of Mormon, its whole record from beginning to end is flatly contradicted by the civilization and the history of Central America.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- <em>The Golden Bible</em>, by M.T. Lamb, p. 366, 370, 373<br />
<br />
&#8220;Let me know state uncategorically that as far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the foregoing to be true,&#8230;nothing, absolutely nothing, has ever shown up in any New World excavation which would suggest to a dispassionate observer that the Book of Mormon... is a historical document relating to the history of early migrants to our hemisphere.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Michael Coe, <em>Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought</em>, Summer 1973, pp. 42, 46<br />
<br />
&quot;The first myth we need to eliminate is that Book of Mormon archaeology exists&#8230;. If one is to study Book of Mormon archaeology, then one must have a corpus of data with which to deal. We do not. The Book of Mormon is really there so one can have Book of Mormon studies, and archaeology is really there so one can study archaeology, but the two are not wed. At least they are not wed in reality since no Book of Mormon location is known with reference to modern topography. Biblical archaeology can be studied because we do know where Jerusalem and Jericho were and are, but we do not know where Zarahemla and Bountiful (nor any other location for that matter) were or are. It would seem then that a concentration on geography should be the first order of business, but we have already seen that twenty years of such an approach has left us empty-handed.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Dee F. Green, Mormon archaeologist, <em>Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought</em>, Summer 1969, pp. 77-78<br />
<br />
&#8220;I'm afraid that up to this point, I must agree with Dee Green, who has told us that to date there is no Book-of-Mormon geography.... you can't set Book of Mormon geography down anywhere &#8211; because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archaeology.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Thomas S. Ferguson, Mormon archaeologist, and author of <em>Quest for the Gold Plates</em>, &#8220;Letter to Mr. and Mrs. H.W. Lawrence,&#8221; dated Feb. 20, 1976<br />
<br />
&#8220;While some people chose to make claims for the Book of Mormon through archaeological evidences, to me they are made prematurely, and without sufficient knowledge. I do not support the books written on this subject including The Messiah in Ancient America, or any other. I believe that the authors are making cases out of too little evidences and do not adequately address the problems that archaeology and the Book of Mormon present. I would feel terribly embarrassed if anyone sent a copy of any book written on the subject to the National Museum of Natural History &#8211; Smithsonian Institution, or other authority, making claims that cannot as yet be substantiated.... there are very severe problems in this field in trying to make correlations with the scriptures. Speculation, such as practiced so far by Mormon authors has not given church members credibility.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Ray T. Matheny, Mormon scholar and BYU professor of anthropology, letter dated Dec. 17, 1987<br />
<br />
&#8220;The Book of Mormon talks about ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industries. A ferrous industry is a whole system of doing something. It's just not an esoteric process that a few people are involved in, but ferrous industry.., means mining iron ores and then processing these ores and casting [them] into irons.... This is a process that's very complicated...it also calls for cultural backup to allow such an activity to take place.... In my recent reading of the Book of Mormon, I find that iron and steel are mentioned in sufficient context to suggest that there was a ferrous industry here.... You can't refine ore without leaving a bloom of some kind or impurities that blossom out and float to the top of the ore... and also the flux of limestone or whatever is used to flux the material.... [This] blooms off into silicas and indestructible new rock forms. In other words, when you have a ferroused metallurgical industry, you have these evidences of the detritus that is left over. You also have the fuels, you have the furnaces, you have whatever technologies that were there performing these tasks; they leave solid evidences. And they are indestructible things.... No evidence has been found in the new world for a ferrous metallurgical industry dating to pre-Columbian times. And so this is a king-size kind of problem, it seems to me, for the so-called Book of Mormon archaeology. This evidence is absent.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Ray T. Matheny, Speech at Sunstone Symposium 6, &quot;Book of Mormon Archaeology,&quot; August 25, 1984<br />
<br />
&quot;I really have difficulty in finding issue or quarrel with those opening chapters of the Book of Mormon [i. e., the first 7 chapters which only relate to Lehi and his family around the area of Jerusalem]. But thereafter it doesn't seem like a translation to me.... And the terminologies and the language used and the methods of explaining and putting things down are 19th century literary concepts and cultural experiences one would expect Joseph Smith and his colleagues would experience. And for that reason I call it transliteration, and I'd rather not call it a translation after the 7th chapter. And I have real difficulty in trying to relate these cultural concepts as I've briefly discussed here with archeological findings that I'm aware of.... &quot;If I were doing this cold like John Carlson is here, I would say in evaluating the Book of Mormon that it had no place in the New World whatsoever. I would have to look for the place of the Book of Mormon events to have taken place in the Old World. It just doesn't seem to fit anything that he has been taught in his discipline, nor I in my discipline in anthropology, history; there seems to be no place for it. It seems misplaced. It seems like there are anachronisms. It seems like the items are out of time and place, and trying to put them into the New World. And I think there's a great difficulty here for we Mormons in understanding what this book is all about.&quot; <br />
<br />
- Ray T. Matheny, Speech at Sunstone Symposium 6, &quot;Book of Mormon Archeology,&quot; August 25, 1984<br />
<br />
&#8220;The American Indians are physically Mongoloids and thus must have originated in Eastern Asia. The differences in appearance of the various New World tribes in recent times are due to (1) the initial variability of their Asian ancestors; (2) adaptations over several millennia to varied New World environments; and (3) different degrees of interbreeding in post-Columbian times with people of European and African origins.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- &#8220;Origins of the American Indians,&#8221; National Museum of Natural History &#8211; Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C., 1985, p. 1<br />
<br />
&#8220;Your recent inquiry concerning the Smithsonian Institution's alleged use of the Book of Mormon as a scientific guide has been received in the Smithsonian's Department of Anthropology.<br />
The Book of Mormon is a religious document and not a scientific guide. The Smithsonian Institution has never used it in archeological research and any information that you have received to the contrary is incorrect. Accurate information about the Smithsonian's position is contained in the enclosed &quot;Statement Regarding the Book of Mormon,&quot; which was prepared to respond to the numerous inquiries that the Smithsonian receives on this topic.<br />
&quot;Because the Smithsonian regards the unauthorized use of its name to disseminate inaccurate information as unlawful, we would appreciate your assistance in providing us with the names of any individuals who are misusing the Smithsonian's name.&#8221;<br />
<br />

&#8220;... our testimony of the Book of Mormon remain[s] a matter of faith, and [is] not based upon external proofs found from archaeology.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Duane R. Aston, <em>Return to Cumorah</em>, 1998<br />
<br />
&#8220;I haven't changed my views about the Book of Mormon since my 1973 article. I have seen no archaeological evidence before or since that date which would convince me that it is anything but a fanciful creation by an unusually gifted individual living in upstate New York in the early nineteenth century.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Michael Coe, correspondence between Bill McKeever and Michael Coe<br />
<br />
&#8220;In 1949 [actually 1946] California lawyer, Tom Ferguson, rolled up his sleeves, threw a shovel over his shoulder, and marched into the remote jungles of southern Mexico. Armed with a quote by Joseph Smith that the Lord had &#8216;a hand in proving the Book of Mormon true in the eyes of all people,' Ferguson's goal was: Shut the mouths of the critics who said such evidence did not exist. Ferguson began an odyssey that included twenty-four trips to Central America, eventually resulting in a mountain of evidence supporting Book of Mormon claims.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Steve Johnson, transcript of the advertisement for <em>The Messiah in Ancient America</em> by Thomas Ferguson, 1988<br />
<br />
&#8220;After many years of careful study, the real importance of Book of Mormon archaeology has dawned on me. It will take but a moment to explain. The Book of Mormon is the only revelation from God in the history of the world that can possibly be tested by scientific physical evidence.... To find the city of Jericho is merely to confirm a point in history. To find the city of Zarahemla is to confirm a point in history but it is also to confirm, through tangible physical evidence, divine revelation to the modern world through Joseph Smith, Moroni, and the Urim and Thummim. Thus, Book of Mormon history is revelation that can be tested by archaeology.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Thomas Ferguson to the First Presidency, April 10, 1953, Ferguson Collection, BYU<br />
<br />
&#8220;One cannot fake over 3000 years&#8230;of history and have the fake hold water under the scrutiny given the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is either fake or fact. If fake, the cities described in it are non-existent. If fact &#8211; as we know it to be &#8211; the cities will be there. If the cities exist, and they do, they constitute tangible, physical, enduring, unimpeachable evidence that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God and that Jesus Christ lives.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Thomas Ferguson to the First Presidency, March 15, 1958, Ferguson Collection, BYU<br />
<br />
&#8220;Right now I am inclined to think that all of those who claim to be &#8216;prophets,' including Moses, were without a means of communicating with deity &#8211; I'm inclined to think that when Moses was on top of the mount, he was talking to himself and decided that the only way he could get the motley crowd at the bottom of the slope to come to order and to listen to him and to heed him was to tell them that he had talked to God on the mount. If this view is correct, then prophets are nothing more than mortal men like the rest of us, except they saw a great need for change and had the courage to say they had communicated with God and had received a message for man, and were believed (though false in the basic claim that the message came from God and not from man).... Right now I think Hoffer [author of True Believer] comes very close to the truth about prophets and organized religions. Right now I am inclined to think that all who believe in &#8216;prophets' as true agents of God are being spoofed &#8211; but perhaps for their own good and welfare. When Joseph Smith crash-landed, a lot came down with him, as I see it.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Thomas Ferguson to Wesley P. Walters, July 6, 1971, Ferguson Collection, University of Utah; see <em>Mormon Mavericks: Essays on Dissenters</em>, p. 263<br />
<br />
&#8220;All elements of religion that are supernatural (including endless string of miracles in the New Testament) are fabrications of men like Joseph Smith.... Further, I presently believe that Mormonism is as good a brand of supernatural religion (which sells well) as any other &#8211; including Protestantism. At the present time I am inclined to believe that supernatural religion, selling as it does, does more good than it does harm (although this is highly debatable).... In my opinion the average Protestant and the average Catholic is as blind to basic truths as is the average Mormon. If I were going to attack Joseph Smith, I would want to attack your beliefs, involving the supernatural, as well as the Mormon beliefs.&#8221;<br />
<br />
- Thomas Ferguson to Hougey, June 26, 1975, Ferguson Collection, University of Utah; see <em>Mormon Mavericks: Essays on Dissenters</em>, p. 263<br />
<br />
&#8220;Why not say the right things and keep your membership in the great fraternity, enjoying the good things you like and discarding the ones you can't swallow (and keeping your mouths shut)? Hypocritical? Maybe. But perhaps a realistic way of dealing with a very difficult problem. There is lots left in the Church to enjoy &#8211; and thousands of members have done, and are doing, what I suggest you consider doing.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;Belonging, with my eyes wide open, is actually fun, less expensive than formerly, and no strain at all. I am now very selective in the meetings I attend, the functions I attend, the amounts I contribute etc. etc. and I have a perfectly happy time. I never get up and bear testimony &#8211; but I don't mind listening to others who do. I am much more tolerant of other religions and other thinking and feel fine about things in general. You might give my suggestions a trial run &#8211; and if you find you have to burn all the bridges between yourselves and the Church, then go ahead and ask for excommunication. The day will probably come &#8211; but it is far off &#8211; when the leadership of the Church will change the excommunication rules and delete as ground non-belief in the 2 books mentioned [the Book of Abraham and the Book of Mormon] and in Joseph Smith as a prophet etc.... but if you wait for that day, you probably will have died. It is a long way off &#8211; tithing would drop too much for one thing.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;I wonder what really goes on in the minds of Church leadership who know of the data concerning the Book of Abraham, the new data on the First Vision, etc.... It would tend to devastate the Church if a top leader were to announce the facts.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;I believe that Judaism was an improvement on polytheism; Christianity was an improvement on Judaism (to some degree and in some departments only); that Protestantism is an improvement on Catholicism; that Mormonism is an improvement on Protestantism. So I give Joseph Smith credit as an innovator and as a smart fellow.&#8221;<br />

&#8220;Since Oliver Cowdery was born in 1806 and was in Poultney from 1809 to 1825, he was resident in Poultney from 3 years of age until he was 19 years of age &#8211; 16 years in all. And these years encompassed the publication of View of the Hebrews, in 1822 [1823] and 1825. His three little half sisters, born in Poultney, were all baptized in Ethan Smith's church. Thus, the family had a close tie with Ethan Smith.&#8221;<br />
