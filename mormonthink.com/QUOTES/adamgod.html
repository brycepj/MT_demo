<p>&quot;Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time.&quot;</p>

Bow, ye thousands, low before him; Minister before his feet.<br />
Hail the patriarch's glad reign, Spreading over sea and main.</p>

Raise aloft your voices million In a torrent pow'r of song.<br />
Hail our head with music soft! Raise sweet melodies aloft!</p>

That the ancient one doth reign In his Father's house again!</p>

<h4>Adam is God</h4>
<p><strong>Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr. (1805-1844):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Everlasting covenant was made between three personages before the organization of this earth, and relates to their dispensation of things to men on the earth; these personages, according to Abraham's record, are called God the first, the Creator; God the second, the Redeemer; and God the third, the witness or Testator.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., <em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, p. 190; online at <a href="http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/basic/godhead/holy_ghost/Overview_EOM.htm">http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/basic/godhead/holy_ghost/Overview_EOM.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;He [Adam] is the father of the human family, and presides over the spirits of all men, and all tha have had the keys must stand before him in this grand council. This may take place before some of us leave this stage of action. The Son of Man stands before him, and there is given him glory and dominion. Adam delivers up his stewardship to Christ, that which was delivered to him as holding the keys of the universe, but retains his standing as head of the human family.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., <em>Messages of the First Presidency</em>, v. 1, p. 113, July 1839. See also History of the Church, v. 3, pp. 386-387; online at <a href="http://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/Adam-God6.html">http://www.mormonfundamentalism.com/Adam-God6.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Prophet Brigham Young (1801-1877):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Now hear it, O inhabitants of the earth, Jew and Gentile, Saint and sinner! When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, the Archangel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken &#8211; He is our FATHER and our GOD, and the only God with whom WE have to do. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and will know it sooner or later!&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 1, p. 51; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-10.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-10.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Here let me state to all philosophers of every class upon earth, When you tell me that father Adam was made as we make adobies from the earth, you tell me what I deem an idle tale. When you tell me that the beasts of the field were produced in that manner, you are speaking idle words devoid of meaning. There is no such thing in all the eternities where the Gods dwell.... Adam and Eve are the parents of all pertaining to the flesh, and I would not say that they are not also the parents of our spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 7, pp. 285, 290; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_07/refJDvol7-44.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_07/refJDvol7-44.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Some have grumbled because I believe our God to be so near to us as Father Adam. There are many who know that doctrine to be true.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 5, p. 331; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_05/refJDvol5-57.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_05/refJDvol5-57.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Though we have it in history that our father Adam was made of the dust of this earth, and that he knew nothing about his God previous to being made here, yet it is not so; and when we learn the truth we shall see and understand that he helped to make this world, and was the chief manager in that operation. He was the person who brought the animals and the seeds from other planets to this world, and brought a wife with him and stayed here. You may read and believe what you please as to what is found written in the Bible. Adam was made from the dust of an earth, but not from the dust of this earth. He was made as you and I are made, and no person was ever made upon any other principle.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 3, pp. 319-320; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_03/refJDvol3-47.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_03/refJDvol3-47.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;I tell you, when you see your Father in the Heavens, you will see Adam; when you see your Mother that bear your spirit, you will see Mother Eve.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 1, p. 50; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-10.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-10.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Some may think what I have said concerning Adam strange, but the period will come when the people will be willing to adopt Joseph Smith as their Prophet, Seer, and Revelator and God! but not the Father of their spirits, for that was our Father Adam.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, Journal History, p. 131, December 11, 1869; online at <a href="http://www.ldshistory.net/adam-god/ag3.html">http://www.ldshistory.net/adam-god/ag3.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Before me I see a house full of Eves. What a crowd of reflections the word Eve is calculated to bring up! Eve was the name or title conferred upon our first mother, because she was actually to be the mother of all human beings who should live upon this earth. I am looking upon a congregation designed to be just such beings.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Millennial Star</em>, v. 31, p. 267; online at <a href="http://www.ldshistory.net/adam-god/ag3.html">http://www.ldshistory.net/adam-god/ag3.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;How much unbelief exists in the minds of the Latter-day Saints in regard to one particular doctrine which I revealed to them, and which God revleaed to me &#8211; namely that Adam is our father and God &#8211; I do not know, I do not inquire, I care nothing about it. Our Father Adam helped to make this earth, it was created expressly for him, and after it was made he and his companions came here. He brought one of his wives with him, and she was called Eve, because she was the first woman upon the earth. Our Father Adam is the man who stands at the gate and holds the keys of everlasting life and salvation to all his children who have or who ever will come upon the earth. I have been found fault with by the ministers of religion because I have said that they were ignorant. But I could not find any man on the earth who cold tell me this, although it is one of the simplest things in the world, until I met and talked with Joseph Smith.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Deseret News</em>, v. 22, no. 308, June 8, 1873; online at <a href="http://www.helpingmormons.org/The_Prophets_Have_Spoken.htm">http://www.helpingmormons.org/The_Prophets_Have_Spoken.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;You believe Adam was made of the dust of this earth. This I do not believe, though it is supposed that it is so written in the Bible; but it is not to my understanding. You can write that information to the States, if you please &#8211; that I have publicly declared that I do not believe that portion of the Bible as the Christian world do. I never did, and I never want to. What is the reason I do not? Because I have come to understanding, and banished from my mind all the baby stories my mother taught me when I was a child.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 2, p. 6; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_02/refJDvol2-2.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_02/refJDvol2-2.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven. Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 1, p. 51; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-10.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-10.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Our Father begot all the spirits that were before any tabernacle was made. When our Father came into the Garden He came with his Celestial body and brought one of his wives with him and ate of the fruit of the Garden until He could beget a Tabernacle. And Adam is Michael God and all the God that we have anything to do with. They ate of this fruit and formed the first Tabernacle that was formed. And when the Virgin Mary was begotten with Child it was by the Father and in no other way only as we were begotten. I will tell you the truth as it is in God. The world don't know that Jesus Christ our Elder Brother was begotten by our Father in Heaven. Handle it was you please, it will either seal the damnation or salvation of man. He was begotten by the Father and not by the Holy Ghost.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, as quoted in the <em>Wilford Woodruff's Journal</em>, April 9, 1852; online at <a href="http://www.lds-mormon.com/veilworker/ag3.shtml">http://www.lds-mormon.com/veilworker/ag3.shtml</a></p>
<p>&quot;... I believe the Father came down from heaven, as the Apostles said he did, and begat the Saviour of the world; for he is the ONLY-begotten of the Father, which could not be if the Father did not actually beget him in person.... I believe the Father came down in His tabernacle and begat Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>- Prophet Brigham Young, <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, v. 1, p. 238; online at <a href="http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-38.html">http://journals.mormonfundamentalism.org/Vol_01/refJDvol1-38.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Apostle Heber C. Kimball (1801 - 1874):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;This brings to my mind the vision that Joseph Smith had, when he saw Adam open the gate of the Celestial City and admit the people one by one. He then saw Father Adam conduct them to the throne one by one, when they were crowned Kings and Priests of God. I merely bring this up to impress upon your mind the principles of order, but it will nevertheless apply to every member of the Church.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have learned by experience that there is but one God that pertains to this people, and He is the God that pertains to this earth &#8211; the first man. That first man sent his own Son to redeem the world, to redeem his brethren; his life was taken, his blood shed, that our sins might be remitted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some have said that I was very presumptuous to say that Brother Brigham was my God and Savior. Brother Joseph was his God. The one that gave Joseph the keys of the Kingdom was his God, which was Peter. Jesus Christ was his God and the God and Father of Jesus Christ was Adam.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Apostle Orson Pratt (1801-1881):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I have heard brother Brigham say that Adam is the Father of our spirits, and he came here with his resurrected body, to fall for his own children; and I said to him, it leads to an endless number of falls, which leads to sorrow and death: that is revolting to my feelings, even if it were not sustained by revelation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I met with the Presidency and Twelve in the prayer-circle after prayer....<br />
&quot;Brother G.A. Smith spoke in plainness his feelings concerning some problems of Elder O Pratt's wherein he differed from President Young concerning the creation of Adam out of the dust of the earth and the final consummation of knowledge and many other things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;President Young followed &amp; made many good remarks . . . He said that our God was Father Adam. He was the Father of the Savior Jesus Christ--Our God was no more or less than Adam . . . Michael the Archangel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to refer to the first doctrine preached that Adam was our Father and God. In the revelation called the Olive Leaf it says that the Devil gathered together the hosts of Hell, and Michael the Archangel gathered together the hosts of Heaven and he overcame the Devil and his angels, and this is the battle of the great God. Who is this Michael the Archangel? It is Adam who was Michael in the creation of the world....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The following is a synopsis of President Young's remarks: Some have thought it strange what I have said concerning Adam, but the period will come when this people of [the] faithful will be willing to adopt Joseph Smith as their Prophet, Seer, Revelator and God, but not the father of their spirits for that was our Father Adam.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who begat the Son of God? Infidels say that Jesus was a bastard, but let me tell you the truth concerning that matter. Our Father begat all the spirits that were, before any tabernacles were made. When our Father came into the garden, He came with His celestial body and brought one of His wives with Him and ate of the fruit of the garden until He could beget a tabernacle, and Adam is Michael or God and all the God that we have anything to do with. They eat of this fruit and formed the first tabernacle that was formed. And when the Virgin Mary was begotten with child, it was by the Father and in no other way, in no other way, only as we were begotten. I will tell you the truth as it is in God. The world don't know that Jesus Christ our elder brother was begotten by our Father in Heaven. Handle it as you please, it will either seal the damnation or salvation of man. He was begotten by the Father and not by the Holy Ghost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brother Cannon said there was a learned Doctor that wanted to be baptized.... He [the doctor] is satisfied that the doctrine of the plurality of God and that Adam is our Father is a true doctrine revealed from God to Joseph and Brigham. For this same doctrine is taught in some of the old Jewish records which have never been in print and I know Joseph Smtih nor Brigham Young have had access to, and the Lord has revealed this doctrine unto them or they could not have taught it. President Young said if all that God had revealed was in fine print it would more than fill this room but very little is written or printed which the Lord has revealed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a request to make of my family &amp; that is that they, especially old people omit calling me their Father. Call me Brother Brigham--I shall feel better when you do for I do not consider that I am worthy of that appellation-- Father in the Priesthood implies the great head, the term would be proper to Father Adam. Jesus had reference to the same thing when he told his disciples not to call any man Father on earth for their Father was in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Apostle Abraham H. Cannon (1859-1896):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;He [George Q. Cannon] believes that Jesus Christ is Jehovah, and that Adam is His father and our God: that under certain unknown conditions the benefits of the Savior's atonement extend to our entire solar system.... He asked me what I understood concerning Mary conceiving the Savior; and as I found no answer, he asked what was to prevent Father Adam from visiting and overshadowing the mother of Jesus. Then I said: 'he must have been a resurrected Being.' 'Yes,' he said, 'and though Christ is said to have been the first fruits of them that slept, yet the Savior said he did nothing but what He had seen His Father do, for He had power to lay down his life and take it up again. Adam, though made of dust, was made, as President Young said, of the dust of another planet than this.' I was very much instructed by the conversation and this days services.&quot;</p>
<p>- Apostle Abraham H. Cannon relating Apostle George Q. Cannon's sentiments, in Journal of Abraham H. Cannon, June 23, 1889, BYU Library Special Collections; online at <a href="http://www.lds-mormon.com/veilworker/adamgod.shtml">http://www.lds-mormon.com/veilworker/adamgod.shtml</a></p>
<p>&quot;At two-o'clock I was at my Quorum meeting where were present all the Presidency and myself, as also Bro. Lyman; Geo. Gibbs, clerk. Bro. Jos. F. Smith was mouth in prayer. Thereafter some conversations followed as to whether Adam is our God or not. There are some in the Church who do not accept of the statement of Pres. Young that such is the case, but to me it seems reasonable to think that Adam has at least much to do with our present condition, and will control greatly our future destiny.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brightest among these spirits, and nearest in the circle to our Father and Mother in heaven (the Father being Adam), were Seth, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus Christ-<br />
&quot;These are the sons and daughters of Adam-the Ancient of Days-the Father and God of the whole human family. These are the sons and daughters of Michael, who is Adam, the father of the spirits of all our race. These are the sons and daughters of Eve, the Mother of a world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When Brigham Young proclaimed to the nations that Adam was our Father and God, and Eve, his partner, the Mother of a world-both in a mortal and celestial sense-he made the most important revelation ever oracled to the race since the days of Adam himself.<br />
This grand patriarchal revelation is the very key-stone of the 'New Creation' of the heavens and the earth. It gives new meaning to the whole system of theology-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Adam is our Father and God. He is the God of the earth.&quot;<br />
&quot;Adam is the great Archangel of this creation. He is Michael. He is the Ancient of Days. He is the father of our elder brother, Jesus Christ--the father of him who shall also come as Messiah to reign. He is the father of the spirits as well as the tabernacles of the sons and daughters of man-Adam!&quot;<br />
&quot;Michael is one of the grand mystical names in the works of creations; redemptions and resurrections.&quot;<br />
&quot;Michael was a celestial, resurrected being, of another world.&quot;<br />
&quot;'In the beginning,' the Gods created the heavens and the earths. In their councils they said, 'Let us make man in our own image.' So, in the likeness of the Fathers, and the Mothers--the Gods--created they man-male and female. When this earth was prepared for mankind, Michael, as Adam, came down. He brought with him one of his wives, and he called her name Eve.&quot;<br />
&quot;Adam and Eve are the names of the fathers and mothers of worlds.&quot;</p>

Also he did not believe that Father Adam had flesh and bones, when he came to the garden of Eden, but he and his wife Eve were spirits, and that God formed their bodies out of the dust of the ground, and the [sic] became a living souls. He also said that he believed that Jesus Christ and Adam are brothers in the Spirit, and that Adam is not the God that he is praying unto.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think these two quotations from such a reliable authority fully solve the question as to the relationship existing between Father Adam and the Savior of the world, and prove beyond question the power that Adam possessed in regard to taking his body again after laying it down--which power he never could have attained unless he had received first a resurrection from the grave to a condition of immortality. We further say that this power was not forfeited when as a celestial being he voluntarily partook of the forbidden fruit, and thereby rendered his body mortal in order that he might become the father of mortal tabernacles, as he was already the father of immortal spirits--thus giving opportunity to the offspring of his own begetting to pass through the ordeals necessary to prepare them for a resurrection from the dead, a celestial glory.<br />
&quot;All that Father Adam did upon this earth, from the time that he took up his abode in the Garden of Eden, was done for his posterity's sake and the success of his former mission as the savior of a world, and afterwards, or now, as the father of a world only added to the glory which he already possessed. If, as the savior of a world, he had the power to lay down his life and take it up again, therefore, as the father of a world which is altogether an advanced condition, we necessarily conclude that the grave was powerless to hold him after that mission was completed...&quot;</p>

&quot;Attended conference, a very interesting conference, for at this meeting President Brigham Young said thus, that Adam and Eve were the names of the first man and woman of every earth that was ever organized and that Adam and Eve were the natural father and mother of every spirit that comes to this planet, or that receives tabernacles on this planet, consequently we are brother and sisters, and that Adam was God, our Eternal Father. This as Brother Heber remarked, was letting the cat out of the bag, and it came to pass, I believed every word, for I remembered saying to the Brethren at a meeting of High Priests in Nauvoo, while I was speaking to them under the influence of the Spirit, I remarked thus, that our Father Adam had many wives, and that Eve was only one of them, and that she was our mother, and that she was the mother of the inhabitants of this earth, and I believe that also, but behold ye there were some that did not believe these sayings of the Prophet Brigham, even our Beloved Brother Orson Pratt told me he did not believe it. He said he could prove by the scriptures it was not correct. I felt very sorry to hear Professor Orson Pratt say that. I feared least he should apostatize, but I prayed for him that he might endure unto the end, for I knew verily it was possible that great men might fall. I remembered Apostle John E. Page. I saw him take from his pocket a plug of tobacco and bite a mouthful and put it back. It surprised me. I said old chap you will apostatize, but still I really hoped he would not, but he is gone, and I am very sorry for the poor man.&quot;</p>

&quot;The doctrine preached by Pres. Young for a few years back, wherein he says that Adam is our God &#8211; the God we worship &#8211; that most of the people believe this &#8211; some believe it because the President says so &#8211; others because they can find testimony in the Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. Amasa Lyman stumbled on this, he did not believe it &#8211; he did not believe in the atonement of Jesus &#8211; Orson Pratt has also told the President that he does not believe it. This is not the way to act. We should not suffer ourselves to entertain one doubt. We are not accountable on points of doctrine if the President makes a statement. It is not our prerogative to dispute it. He is only accountable in points of doctrine. I have heard President Young avow the truth of Adam being our Father and God but have never heard him argue the question at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I would speak briefly in relation to Adam being our God. Since the year 1852 when the President first spoke on this subject. I have frequently endeavored to reconcile what I have read with regard to this matter. I believe what the President says on the subject although it comes in contract with all our tradition. I have not any doubt in my mind but that Adam is our God. Who his God and Father may be, I have no knowledge. President Kimball spoke on this question recently and very plainly illustrated the character and relationship of our Father and God.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not disposed to question the discrepancies on the question of doctrine; if we live faithful all will become clear to us. We cannot become united only as we get united in understanding. When I first heard the doctrine of Adam being our Father and God, I was favorably impressed &#8211; enjoyed, and hailed it as a new revelation. It appeared reasonable to me, as the Father of our spirits that he should introduce us here. And what we do not see is only evidence that we have not the light necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Conference commenced on the 6 and continued until the 11, it was heled in the new tabernacle, adjourned until the 6 of next October We had the best Conference that I ever attended during the time of the Conference President Brigham Young said that our spirits ware begotten before that Adam came to the Earth and that Adam helped to make the Earth, that he had a Celestial boddy when he came to the Earth and that he brought his wife or one of his wives with him, and that Eave was allso a Celestial being, that they eat of the fruit of the ground until they begat children from the Earth, he said that Adam was the onley God that we would have, and that Christ was not begotten of the Holy Gost, but of the Father Adam, that Christ, was our elder brother. The argument that he used to shoe that Christ was not begotten by the holy gost, was a caution to the Elders that when they should go to preach the Gospel, to be careful how they laid their hands on the sisters, for the reseption of the holy Gost, lest the holy Gost should get them with Child and that it would be laid to them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At Special Priesthood meeting at which the official statement of the First Presidency regarding the teachings of Adam-God is presented, Prest. Jos. F. Smith then said that he was in full accord with what Prest. Penrose had said and that Prest. Brigham Young when he delivered that sermon only expressed his own views and that they were not corroborated by the word of the Lord in the stand works of the Church. The Bible, Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price and Doctrine and Covenants were voted upon by the Church convened in a Conference and organized in various Quorums of the Priesthood who voted by Quorums after which the body of the Church were asked to vote to sustain the above books as the Standards of the Church....<br />
&quot;Now all doctrine if it can't be established by these standards is not to be taught or promulgated by members. That those Patriarchs who persisted in teaching these things and did not stop when told to do so should be handled by their Bishops and their names sent up to the High Councils for further action and be cut off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brother Horne and I chatted again tonight about the Gospel and the Adam-God Doctrine, as we have done many times before. Brother Horne, who grew up in Salt Lake City and was the son of Richard Horne and grandson of Joseph Horne said, in reference to the Adam-God Doctrine, that when he first went through the Temple for his Endowment in 1902 before going on his mission he was surprised to hear the teachings during the Temple ceremony in the sermon before the veil, that 'Adam was our God' and that 'he came here with Eve, one of his wives.' Also it was taught that 'Eve bore our spirits' (i.e. the spirits of all men). He asked his father about it but he declined to give any opinion about it. After Brother Horne returned from his mission a few years later, in 1905, he noted these teachings had been removed from the Temple ceremony. He feels that they were left over from Brigham Young's influence, but that the himself couldn't believe such doctrine. He thinks perhaps Brigham just got off in his speculation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pres. Jensen referred to the condition of some of the High Priests in the Malad Ward who were contending one with another concerning some point of doctrine, which they did not understand. The point in dispute being, was Adam was God, some taking the affirmation and some the negative of the question. That was not right. We ought to allow these matters to rest until our minds were better informed regarding them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ADAM, THE FATHER AND GOD OF THE HUMAN FAMILY<br />
&quot;The above sentiment appeared in Star No. 48, a little to the surprise of some of its readers; and while the sentiment may have appeared blasphemous to the ignorant, it has no doubt given rise to some serious reflections with the more candid and comprehensive mind. A few reasonable and scriptural ideas upon this subject may be profitable at the present time.<br />
&quot;Then Adam is really God! And why not? If there are Lords many and Gods many, as the scriptures inform us, why not our Father Adam be one of them?&quot;</p>
<p>- Mission President Samuel W. Richards, <em>Millennial Star</em>, v. 15, p. 801; online at <a href="http://messenger.mormonfundamentalism.org/Adam-Buerger.htm">http://messenger.mormonfundamentalism.org/Adam-Buerger.htm</a></p>
<p>&quot;It has been said that Adam is the God and Father of the human family, and persons are perhaps in fear and great trouble of mind, lest they have to acknowledge him as such in some future day. For our part we would much rather acknowledge Adam to be our Father than hunt for another and take up with the devil. Whoever is acknowledged Father must have the rights and honor that belong to him. No man may ever expect to attain to more than he is willing others should enjoy. If these things have power to disturb the pure mind, we apprehend that even greater troubles than these may arise before mankind learn all the particulars of Christ's incarnation---Whatever may prove to be the facts in the case it certainly would exhibit a great degree of weakness on the part of anyone to indulge in fears and anxieties about that which he has no power to control. Facts still remain facts whether kept or revealed. If there is a way pointed out by which all beings who come into this world can lay the foundation for rule, and a never-ending increase of kingdoms and dominions, by which they can become Gods, we are all willing the Lord Jesus Christ should enjoy them all as any other being, ascribing honor and power to him as their God. The Apostle informs us that those who are redeemed shall be like Jesus; not to say, however, that they shall be wifeless and childless, and without eternal affections. It should be borne in mind that these wonderful mysteries, as they are supposed to be, are only mysteries because of the ignorance of men; and when men and women are troubled in spirit over these things which come to light through the proper channel of intelligence, they only betray their weakness, ignorance, and folly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... some of the officers have not met in council for three years. They are lacking faith on one principle &#8211; the looast 'cat that was let out of the bag.'

<p>&quot;Concerning the item of doctrine alluded to by Elder Caffall and others, viz., that Adam is our Father and God, I have to say do not trouble yourselves...If, as Elder Caffall remarked, there are those who are waiting at the door of the Church for this objection to be removed, tell such, the Prophet and Apostle Brigham has declared it, and that it is the word of the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>A Voice of Dissent:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;President John Taylor</p>
<p>Sir,<br />
Duty imperatively demands that as I am about to withdraw from the Church over which you preside I make known to you and to all whom it may concern the reasons which have compelled me to take this step.</p>
<p>When I joined the Mormon Church a little over 5 years ago I believed implicitly as I do now that the Bible was the word of God and the Rule of Faith and while the 'Book of Mormon' and 'Doctrine and Covenants' were referred to as additional revelation they no where contradicted the Bible but rather established it.</p>
<p>Before joining the Church I became acquainted with Elders Wm. Budge, John Nicholson, Francis Cope, james L. Bunting, and others. Elder Nicholson preached from the Bible only and almost entirely dwelt on what is known as the first principles claiming that these principles were what had been introduced by our Savior and preached by his immediate apostles but that men had wandered away from them and had fallen into darkness and superstition. I had heard a great many things about the Mormons that were nothing to their credit consequently the eminent social qualities and gentlemanly conduct of Elder Cope won my admiration and esteem. I was greatly pleased to find him a monogamist for while I could not deny that many good men in the past had had more wives than one, I never for one moment assented to the idea that there was any virtue in such a proceeding or that it merited or would receive any reward.</p>
<p>I joined your Church on the 20th of May 1879 and during the first 2 years of my membership I faithfully adhered to it and would have given my life to defend it, during all this time I never heard of Adam being God, never heard of Blood Atonement, never heard of polygamy being required of all men before they could attain to highest glory. Never dreamed that Brigham Young or any one else coolly threw the Bible overboard and preached whatever they pleased which I was bound to accept as revelations of God. I do not and cannot cease these men of having told me anything absolutely false, but they certainly withheld the horrible. I was in the Church some five years before I heard or knew anything about those things &#8211; doctrines against which my soul revolts...</p>
<p>I imagined that I had come to the kingdom of God to help build it up! What did I find? I found that God, the God of the Bible is not even worshipped by the Church over which you preside, the God you worship is Adam. Brigham Young teaches I quote his words, 'When our Father Adam came into the Garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body and brought Eve one of his wives with him. He is our Father and our God and the ONLY God with whom we have to do.' At first I could not bring myself to believe that this doctrine was accepted by the Church, but on careful inquiry found to my horror and astonishment that it was really so. It is true a great many know nothing about it and are simply in ignorance. Those who do not know accept it as far more to be relied on than any portion of the Bible, for say they the Bible has been translated over and over again and may be wrong but this is the direct teaching of a Great Prophet.</p>
<p>I reject this as abominable and horrible idolatry and give it as one reason why I cannot remain in your Church.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>B.H. Roberts, Seventy and LDS Church Historian (1869 &#8211; 1965):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;As a matter of fact, the 'Mormon' church does not teach that doctrine [Adam-God].&quot;</p>
<p>- B.H. Roberts, Quorum of the Seventy, LDS Church Historian, <em>Deseret News</em>, July 23, 1921; online at <a href="http://www.fairmormon.org/pubs/tagm/tagm23.html">http://www.fairmormon.org/pubs/tagm/tagm23.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;Some of the sectarian ministers are saying that we 'Mormons' are ashamed of the doctrine announced by President Brigham Young to the effect that Adam will thus be God of this world. No, friends, it is not that we are ashamed of that doctrine. If you see any change come over our countenances when this doctrine is named, it is surprise, astonishment, that anyone at all capable of grasping the largeness and extent of the universe &#8211; the grandeur of existence and the possibilities in man for growth, for progress, should be lean of intellect, should have such a paucity of understanding, as to call it in question at all. That is what our change of countenance means &#8211; not shame &#8211; for the doctrine Brigham Young taught.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Apostle Bruce R. McConkie (1915 - 1985):</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Yes, President Young did teach that Adam was the Father of our spirits, and all the related things that the cultists ascribe to him. This however, is not true. He expressed views that are out of harmony with the gospel.... Wise gospel students do not build their philosophies of life on the quotations of individuals, even though those quotations come from presidents of the Church.&quot;</p>
