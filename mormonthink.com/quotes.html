<p>3. Philosophy is questions that may never be answered. Religion is answers that may never be questioned. - Anonymous</p>
<p>4. Since the Bible and the church are obviously mistaken in telling us where we came from, how can we trust them to tell us where we are going? - Anonymous</p>
<p>5. I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do because I notice it always coincides with their own desires. - Susan B. Anthony</p>

<p>7. Two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer. &#8211; Anonymous</p>
<p>8. All the biblical miracles will at last disappear with the progress of science. - Matthew Arnold</p>
<p>9. Blind faith is an ironic gift to return to the Creator of human intelligence. - Anonymous </p>

<p>12. You do not need the Bible to justify love, but no better tool has been invented to justify hate. - Richard A. Weatherwax<br />
<br />

<br />
14. Religion does three things quite effectively: Divides people, Controls people, Deludes people. - Carlespie Mary Alice McKinney</p>
<p>15. Religion has caused more misery to all of mankind in every stage of human history than any other single idea. - Anonymous</p>
<p>16. Faith does not give you the answers, it just stops you asking the questions. - Frater Ravus</p>
<p>17. When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion. - Robert Pirsig</p>

<p>19. Religion is the opiate of the masses. - Karl Marx</p>
<p>20. If we expect God to subscribe to one religion at the exclusion of all the others, then we should expect damnation as a matter of chance. This should give Christians pause when expounding their religious beliefs, but it does not. - Sam Harris</p>
<p>21. Religions are like pills, which must be swallowed whole without chewing. - Anonymous</p>
<p>22. Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, even if religion vanished; but religious superstition dismounts all these and erects an absolute monarchy in the minds of men. - Francis Bacon <br />
<br />
23. A God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd; a God who interfered with human freedom and creativity was tyrant. If God is seen as a self in a world of his own, an ego that relates to a thought, a cause separate from its effect. he becomes a being, not Being itself.

<br />
27. In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point. - Friedrich Nietzsche <br />
<br />
28. It will yet be the proud boast of women that they never contributed a line to the Bible. - George W. Foote <br />
<br />
29. I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours. - Stephen Roberts <br />
<br />
30. As far as I can tell from studying the scriptures, all you do in heaven is pretty much just sit around all day and praise the Lord. I don't know about you, but I think that after the first, oh, I don't know, 50,000,000 years of that I'd start to get a little bored. - Rick Reynolds <br />
<br />
31. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day; teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime; give a man religion and he will die praying for a fish. - Anonymous <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
37.And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence. - Bertrand Russell <br />
<br />
38. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? - Epicurus <br />
<br />
39. I'm a polyatheist - there are many gods I don't believe in. - Dan Fouts <br />
<br />
40. If it turns out that there is a God, I don't think that he's evil. But the worst that you can say about him is that basically he's an underachiever. - Woody Allen <br />
<br />
41. A lie is a lie even if everyone believes it. The truth is the truth even if nobody believes it. - David Stevens <br />
<br />
42. Men rarely (if ever) manage to dream up a God superior to themselves. Most Gods have the manners and morals of a spoiled child. - Robert A Heinlein <br />
<br />
43. I refuse to prove that I exist,&#8221; says God, &#8220;for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing. - Douglas Adams <br />

<br />
47. Which is it, is man one of God's blunders or is God one of man's? - Friedrich Nietzsche <br />
<br />
48. When a man is freed of religion, he has a better chance to live a normal and wholesome life. - Sigmund Freud <br />
<br />
49. They felt that science would be corrosive to religious belief and they were worried about it. Damn it, I think they were right. It is corrosive to religious belief and it's a good thing. - Steven Weinberg <br />
<br />
50. Take from the church the miraculous, the supernatural, the incomprehensible, the unreasonable, the impossible, the unknowable, the absurd, and nothing but a vacuum remains. - Robert G. Ingersoll <br />
<br />
51. History teaches us that no other cause has brought more death than the word of god. - Giulian Buzila <br />
<br />
52. Atheism is a non-prophet organization. - George Carlin <br />
<br />
53. We are all atheists about most of the gods that societies have ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further. - Richard Dawkins <br />
<br />
54. A believer states everything must have a creator but fail to say how he was created. - Anonymous <br />
<br />
55. &#8220;There are no atheists in foxholes&#8221; isn't an argument against atheism, it's an argument against foxholes. - James Morrow <br />
<br />
56. People will then often say, &#8216;But surely it's better to remain an Agnostic just in case?' This, to me, suggests such a level of silliness and muddle that I usually edge out of the conversation rather than get sucked into it. (If it turns out that I've been wrong all along, and there is in fact a god, and if it further turned out that this kind of legalistic, cross-your-fingers- behind-your- back, Clintonian hair-splitting impressed him, then I think I would choose not to worship him anyway.) - Douglas Adams <br />
<br />
57. Properly read, the bible is the most potent force for Atheism ever conceived. - Isaac Asimov <br />

<br />

<br />
64. No philosophy, no religion, has ever brought so glad a message to the world as this good news of Atheism. - Annie Wood Besant <br />
<br />
65. I refuse to believe in a god who is the primary cause of conflict in the world, preaches racism, sexism, homophobia, and ignorance, and then sends me to hell if I'm &#8216;bad'. - Mike Fuhrman <br />
<br />
66. Believing there is no God gives me more room for belief in family, people, love, truth, beauty, sex, Jell-o, and all the other things I can prove and that make this life the best life I will ever have. - Penn Jillette <br />

<br />
74. What has been Christianity' s fruits? Superstition, Bigotry and Persecution. - James Madison <br />
<br />
75. The characters and events depicted in the damn bible are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. - Penn and Teller <br />
<br />
76. If god is the alpha and the omega. The begining and the end, knows what has passed and what is to come, like it states in the bible, why do people pray and think it will make any difference. - Mark Fairclough <br />
<br />
77. If God created the world, then who created god? and who created whoever created god? So somewhere along the line something had to just be there. So why can't we just skip the idea of god and go straight to earth? - Ryan Hanson <br />

<br />

<br />
89. Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? - Douglas Adams</p>
<p>90. The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. - Richard Dawkins</p>

<br />
94. We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes. - Gene Roddenberry <br />
<br />

<br />
97. If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words.

<br />
98. Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination. - Edward Abbey <br />
<br />

<p>105. Faith does not give you the answers, it just stops you asking the questions. - Frater Ravus</p>

<p>107. &quot;If there is a God, he is a malign thug.&quot; Mark Twain</p>

<p>109. &quot;Religion is simply a community of people who gather together on a regular basis to reassure each other that it is okay to continue believing in absurdities. But for me it is far better to see the world as it really exists, rather than persist in delusion, no matter how comforting that may seem.&quot; Unknown</p>
<p>110. &quot;Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.&quot;<br />
-The Buddha</p>
<p>111. &quot;When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad. That's my religion.&quot; ~Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>112. Do not believe anything because it is said by an authority, or if it is said to come from angels, or from Gods, or from an inspired source. Believe it only if you have explored it in your own heart and mind and body and found it to be true. Work out your own path, through diligence.<br />
~ Guatama Buddha </p>
<p>113. &quot;All religion, my friend, is simply evolved out of fraud, fear, greed, imagination, and poetry.&quot; <br />
Edgar Allan Poe </p>
<p>114. Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool. Voltaire </p>
<p>115. You know you've created God in your own image when he hates all the same people you do. - unknown</p>
<p>116. This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness. Dalai Lama</p>
<p>117. Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.&#8212; Blaise Pascal.</p>
<p>118. He who knows only his own faith knows no faith.&#8212; Anonymous</p>
<p>119. In comes ideology and out goes common sense. This is my experience of life &#8212; Doris Lessing</p>
<p>120. I've begun worshiping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It's there for me every day. And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat, light, food, a lovely day. There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to God are all answered at about the same 50-percent rate.&#8221; George Carlin.</p>
<p>121. Religion was invented when the first con man met the first fool. Mark Twain</p>
<p>122. God was invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand. Richard Feynman, physicist, awarded Nobel Prize in 1965.</p>
<p>123. Science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the nonexistence of Zeus or Thor - but they have few followers now. Sir Arthur C. Clarke</p>
<p>124. (A Mormon-related general quote): That is one of the beautiful things about Mormonism. It has always been proven true in the studies that have not been written, research that has not been conducted and archeological evidence that has not been dug. John Larsen</p>
<p>125. A faith which cannot survive collision with the truth is not worth many regrets. Arthur C. Clarke </p>
<p>126. &quot;Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe - a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive.&quot; Albert Einstein</p>
<p>127. &quot;What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary.&quot; Stephen Hawking </p>
<p>128. [not necessarily religious but included anyway] &#8220;It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.&#8221; &#8213; Mark Twain</p>

Delusion is believing when there is an abundance of evidence against something.&quot; </span></span></span>Jeremy Runnells 2013.</p>
<p>130. &quot;To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.&quot; Voltaire</p>
<p>131. Morality is doing what is right regardless of what you are told. Religion is doing what you are told regardless of what is right.</p>
<p>132. <strong><em>Philosophy</em></strong><em> is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat.&#160; <strong>Metaphysics</strong> is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there.&#160; <strong>Theology</strong> is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there and shouting &#8220;I found it!&#8221;</em> - Citation found at http://www.godlessgeeks.com/; accessed 05.22.2009.</p>

<p>138. &quot;The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of primitive legends which are pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this.&quot;* Albert Einstein, 1954</p>
<p>139. &quot;During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution, human fantasy created gods in man's own image who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate influence, the phenomenal world.&quot; - Albert Einstein, quoted in: 2000 Years of Disbelief, James Haught</p>
<p>140. &quot;A man's ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.&quot; -- Albert Einstein, &quot;Religion and Science&quot;, New York Times Magazine, 9 November 1930</p>

<p>142. Tell people there's an invisible man in the sky who created the universe, and the vast majority will believe you. Tell them the paint is wet, and they have to touch it to be sure. George Carlin</p>
<p>143. If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things. Ren&eacute; Descartes</p>
<p>144. Christianity has done its utmost to close the circle and declared even doubt to be sin. Friedrich Nietzsche </p>
<p>145. Another general Mormon-related quote: &quot;It is better to have nothing to do with the Church in the first place, than to try Mormonism and fail.&quot; poster on Mormon Discussions.</p>
