                  Joseph Smith had the power to grant their desires. Confidence 
                  in their Prophet was not misplaced. Between 1830 and 1836, 
                  under the supervision of Joseph Smith, many early Mormon 
                  converts enjoyed heavenly visions and spiritual raptures. 
                  However, after Joseph’s death in 1844, the great visionary 
                  period of Church history came to an end.</STRONG></FONT></P>

                  religious historians, ethnobotanists and ethnomycologists. It

                  Smith can be acquired in the course of consuming visionary 
                  plants, mushrooms and cactus. Otherwise known as psychedelics 
                  and hallucinogens, when these visionary materials are taken in

                  has been a maturing theory of entheogens and the origins of 
                  religion. In September 2006, Michael S. Hoffman summarized 
                  what is now believed by many to be the relationship between 
                  religion and entheogens. The entheogen theory of religion 
                  holds that the main origin and ongoing wellspring of religion 
                  is visionary plants… [such as] Peyote … Datura … and Amanita

                    Joseph told us to again take our positions in prayer. We did

                  Datura occasioned early Mormon convert visions rather than 
                  hypnosis, mass hysteria or spontaneous religious experience? 
                  Datura has been shown to be over 80 percent effective in 
                  creating a visionary experience whereas hypnosis is much less 
                  reliable, probably less than 10 percent. An even smaller 
                  percentage, likely less than 1 percent, will experience 
                  spontaneous heavenly visions. Datura would not only account 
                  for the high percentage of early Church converts having 
                  visionary experience following the ingestion of sacramental 
                  wine, but may also explain the accompanying untamed thoughts 
                  and behaviors that attended early Mormon sacrament

                  vision story depicts similar strange thoughts and behaviors.

                  his vision was severely impaired, he saw all kinds of 
                  “improper pictures”, he believed he was going to be destroyed,

                  Smith personified these strange manifestations as the actions 
                  of a being from the unseen world. This is consistent with 
                  Joseph’s analysis of the bizarre manifestations in 1831 
                  Kirtland Ohio as being the responsibility of a lying spirit. 
                  However, Joseph would contradict this view in 1843 when he 
                  explained that evil spirits can neither manipulate the 
                  physical world nor occasion strange physical manifestations. 
                  Joseph explained to apparently worried Church members that if 
                  such a being was encountered and attempted to physically 
                  interact, nothing at all would be felt. <EM><FONT

                    the heavens opened above my head. In an instant I was 
                    flooded with light from above, light of the utmost whiteness 
                    and splendor that quickly dissolved everything in its glory. 
                    The bliss I had experienced prior to this new revelation now 
                    paled to insignificance in an immensity of light that was 
                    also the purest love. As the truth of the situation dawned 
                    on me the word "FATHER" resounded in this heaven of light 
                    and I was taken up and absorbed by the unspeakable Godhead.

                  transformed into a woolly lamb, then a brilliant red fruit; a

                  utilization of the visionary Datura plant and the sacred

                  entheogen theory of the rise of Mormonism proves to be

                  complete the Nauvoo temple, the visionary experiences
