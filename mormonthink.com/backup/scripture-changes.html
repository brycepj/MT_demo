<P>Joseph Smith Preaching to the Indians</P></DIV>
<P class="notextindent">t the end of February, 2013, the <EM>Deseret News</EM> 
featured an amazing article: “LDS Church Announces New Scripture Edition.”<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a1" 
name="ra1">[1]</A> Utah was buzzing with people trying to determine what had 
been changed and why. The article noted that the changes included “revisions to 
study aids, new photos, updated maps,” “making historical and contextual 
adjustments to the section headings of 76 sections of the <EM>Doctrine and 
Covenants</EM>,” and “adding introductory headings to both official declarations 
at the end of the <EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM>.”</P>
<P>According to the same article the LDS Church began working on this project in 
2004. Currently the new edition is only available on the LDS web site, and the 
print version will be available in August 2013.</P>
<P>While many of the changes seem to be minor, some are obviously being made to 
counter historical problems raised by church critics. In 2011 an online survey 
of about 3,000 disaffected Mormons, conducted by Open Stories Foundation, 
revealed:</P>
<P class="quote">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 81 percent [of disaffected Mormons] cited loss 
of faith in Mormon founder Joseph Smith as a moderate or strong factor in their 
no longer believing in the LDS Church. Another 84 percent said they studied LDS 
history and lost their faith. About 79 percent lost faith in Mormonism’s 
founding scripture, the Book of Mormon.</P>
<P class="quote">The survey .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. found that the two historical issues 
that most negatively affected belief in the faith were “the Book of Abraham”—a 
Mormon text that Smith said was based on Egyptian papyri he obtained—and 
polygamy, which the church abandoned in 1890.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a2" 
name="ra2">[2]</A></P>
<P>Some of the alterations to the introductory material in the 2013 edition of 
LDS scriptures seem to be aimed at lessening the tension on these problem 
areas.</P>
<P>In the following material we will examine some of the major changes in the 
2013 edition of LDS scriptures and discuss their significance.</P><A id="boa" 
name="boa"></A>
<P class="subheading-1">Book of Abraham</P>
<P>In 1835 Joseph Smith arranged for the LDS Church to purchase a collection of 
ancient Egyptian papyri for $2,400 (equivalent to about $65,000 in 2012). Such a 
large investment was done despite the severe financial problems of the church, 
which shows the significance of the papyri in Smith’s mind. He soon announced 
that one of the papyri contained the actual writings of the biblical 
Abraham:</P>
<P class="quote">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I commenced the <STRONG>translation</STRONG> of 
some of the characters or hieroglyphics, and much to our joy found that 
<STRONG>one of the rolls contained the writings of Abraham</STRONG>, 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a3" 
name="ra3">[3]</A></P>
<P>Smith’s translation of the papyri was published first in the 1842 <EM>Times 
and Seasons</EM>, in Nauvoo, Illinois, and then in England as part of the 1851 
edition of the <EM>Pearl of Great Price</EM>, although not canonized until 
1880.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a4" name="ra4">[4]</A> 
During this time, as scholars in the nineteenth century developed the ability to 
translate Egyptian hieroglyphics, criticism of Smith’s “translation” grew. Then, 
in December of 1912, the <EM>New York Times</EM> printed an article debunking 
Smith’s translation of the papyri titled “Museum Walls Proclaim Fraud of Mormon 
Prophet.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a5" 
name="ra5">[5]</A> From that point on dozens of articles and publications, 
quoting current Egyptologists, have demonstrated that the Book of Abraham text 
is not a translation of the papyri.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a6" 
name="ra6">[6]</A> This seems to have been the motivation for the recent change 
in the Introduction to the <EM>Pearl of Great Price</EM>. In the 1981 
Introduction we read:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>The Book of Abraham. <STRONG>A translation from some 
Egyptian papyri</STRONG> that came into the hands of Joseph Smith in 1835, 
<STRONG>containing writings of the patriarch Abraham</STRONG></EM>.</P>
<P>The 2013 Introduction to the <EM>Pearl of Great Price</EM> reads:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>The Book of Abraham. An <STRONG>inspired 
translation</STRONG> of the writings of Abraham. Joseph Smith began the 
translation in 1835 <STRONG>after obtaining some Egyptian 
papyri.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>Notice the subtle shift from a direct translation to “inspired” in an effort 
to distance Smith’s text from the papyri. This seems to be a concession that the 
Book of Abraham text is not a translation of the papyri, thus alleviating the 
need to defend Smith’s interpretation.</P>
<P>When we examine the Book of Abraham itself we find that the church has 
removed the heading at the start of the book:</P>
<P class="quote">Translated from the Papyrus, by Joseph Smith.</P>
<P>Oddly, they have left unchanged the rest of the heading to the Book of 
Abraham, which still announces that the text is an actual translation of the 
papyrus:</P>
<P class="quote"><STRONG><EM>A Translation of some ancient Records that have 
fallen into our hands from the catacombs of Egypt</EM>.</STRONG> <EM>The 
writings of Abraham while he was in Egypt, called the Book of Abraham, 
<STRONG>written by his own hand, upon papyrus</STRONG></EM>.</P>
<P>This uneven editing leaves one wondering what they consider to be the 
connection between the papyrus and the text? Past leaders clearly believed the 
Book of Abraham was literally a translation of the papyrus.</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">The Facsimiles</P>
<P>Even if one were to accept their new explanation that the Book of Abraham was 
an “inspired translation” (i.e. a product of revelation from God, independent of 
the actual meaning of the papyri), the problem still remains regarding the 
drawings that accompany the translation. These facsimiles are clearly based on 
the images found on the Egyptian material. Smith described Facsimile No.&nbsp;1 
(shown below) as “Abraham fastened upon an altar” and the “idolatrous priest of 
Elkenah attempting to offer up Abraham as a sacrifice.”</P>
<P class="center"><IMG class="imgborderblack" alt="Facsimile #1" src="http://mormonthink.com/backup/scripture-changes_files/120facsimile1.gif" 
width="500" height="490"></P>
<P>Below is a photo of the original papyrus from which Facsimile No. 1 was 
drawn.</P>
<P class="center"><A 
href="http://utlm.org/images/newsletters/120/120papyri.gif"><IMG alt="Original Papyrus" 
src="http://mormonthink.com/backup/scripture-changes_files/120papyri_small.gif" width="500" 
height="326"></A></P>
<P>Contrary to Smith’s explanations in the <EM>Pearl of Great Price</EM>, this 
is a standard Egyptian drawing relating to the embalming of the dead. The 
standing black figure is actually Anubis, the Egyptian god of the dead.<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a7" name="ra7">[7]</A> Smith’s Book 
of Abraham is clearly dependent on Facsimile No. 1. In Abraham 1:12 we read 
“that you may have a knowledge of this altar, I will refer you to <STRONG>the 
representation at the commencement of this record</STRONG>.” Thus the Book of 
Abraham claims to be an actual translation with an illustration of Abraham being 
sacrificed. How can the LDS Church divorce the text of the Book of Abraham from 
the papyrus yet accept the facsimiles as part of Abraham’s record?</P>
<P>Smith’s explanation of Facsimiles No. 2 and 3 are likewise in error. Yet at 
the end of the explanation of Facsimile No. 2 we read: “The above 
<STRONG>translation</STRONG> is given as far as we [meaning Joseph Smith] have 
any right to give at the present time.” However, nothing has been “translated.” 
The text describing the illustrations does not conform to any actual translation 
of the Egyptian characters and appears to be entirely fabricated from Smith’s 
imagination. Noted Egyptologist James H. Breasted, Ph.D., gave this evaluation 
of Smith’s explanations of the facsimiles:</P>
<P class="quote">These three facsimiles of Egyptian documents in the “Pearl of 
Great Price” depict the most common objects in the mortuary religion of Egypt. 
Joseph Smith’s interpretations of them as part of a unique revelation through 
Abraham, therefore, very clearly demonstrate that he was totally unacquainted 
with the significance of these documents and absolutely ignorant of the simplest 
facts of Egyptian writing and civilization.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a8" 
name="ra8">[8]</A></P>
<P>Even LDS Egyptologist John Gee appears to see the problems with Smith’s 
purported translation and seems to downplay the significance of those issues. 
Speaking at the 2009 F.A.I.R. Conference he stated: “How the Book of Abraham was 
translated is unimportant. The Church does not stand or fall on the Book of 
Abraham.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a9" 
name="ra9">[9]</A> However, many people leaving Mormonism disagree. If Joseph 
Smith fails as a translator of the Book of Abraham where his translation can be 
checked against the papyrus, why would anyone believe his “translation” of the 
Book of Mormon when there is no evidence that the gold plates ever existed?<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a10" 
name="ra10">[10]</A></P><A id="bom" name="bom"></A>
<P class="subheading-1">Book of Mormon</P>
<P>The Introduction to the Book of Mormon has undergone a few significant 
changes. In the first sentence of the 1981 edition we read:</P>
<P class="quote">The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to 
the Bible. It is a record of God’s dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the 
Americas and contains, <STRONG>as does the Bible</STRONG>, the fulness of the 
everlasting gospel.</P>
<P>The phrase “as does the Bible” has been deleted. It is assumed that it was 
removed to enhance the importance of the Book of Mormon. After all, if the Bible 
contains the fulness of the gospel why would we need the Book of Mormon?</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Lamanites</P>
<P>The Book of Mormon describes the migration of a group of Israelites from 
Jerusalem to the New World in about 600 BC. A few years after settling in 
America these people divided into two groups, the righteous Nephites and the 
wicked Lamanites. In the past Mormonism has claimed that the American Indians 
are the descendants of the Lamanites but in recent years this claim has been 
modified. In the Introduction to the 1981 Book of Mormon we read:</P>
<P class="quote">After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the 
Lamanites, and they are <STRONG>the principal ancestors</STRONG> of the American 
Indians.</P>
<P>This has been changed to read:</P>
<P class="quote">After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the 
Lamanites, and they are <STRONG>among the ancestors</STRONG> of the American 
Indians.</P>
<P>This change seems to have been made in response to the recent research on 
Native American DNA,<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a11" 
name="ra11">[11]</A> which shows that almost all indigenous people of North and 
South America are Asiatic, not Semitic.</P>
<P>Also in the front part of the Book of Mormon is a section titled “Testimony 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith.” In this article Smith recounts the message given 
to him by the angel who told him of the gold plates containing the text of the 
Book of Mormon:</P>
<P class="quote">He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, 
giving an account of the <STRONG>former inhabitants of this continent</STRONG>, 
and the source from whence they sprang.</P>
<P>Again we see the Native Americans associated with the Book of Mormon people. 
Past LDS Church writings repeatedly referred to Native Americans as Lamanites, 
descendents of the Book of Mormon people. In fact some of the earliest LDS 
missionary efforts were to the “Lamanites” in New York, Ohio and Missouri 
(<EM>D&amp;C</EM> 28:9; 32:2).<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a12" 
name="ra12">[12]</A> Now that those people can no longer be claimed as 
descendents of Israelites, the church has stopped referring to them as 
“Lamanites.” But this leaves the Mormons with no identifiable group that has 
descended from the Book of Mormon people. One of Smith’s revelations 
prophesied:</P>
<P class="quote">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this testimony shall come to the knowledge of 
the <STRONG>Lamanites</STRONG>, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <STRONG>for this very 
purpose</STRONG> are these plates preserved, which contain these records 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the <STRONG>Lamanites</STRONG> might come to the knowledge 
of <STRONG>their fathers</STRONG>, and that they might know the promises of the 
Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (<EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM> 3:18-20).</P>
<P>This leaves one to wonder how the LDS can take the gospel to the descendents 
of the Book of Mormon people if they can’t identify anyone as a Lamanite?</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Racism</P>
<P>Traditionally LDS Church leaders have explained that the reason Native 
Americans are dark is that they are descended from the cursed Lamanites.</P>
<P class="quote">And he [the Lord] had caused <STRONG>the cursing</STRONG> to 
come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wherefore, as they were 
<STRONG>white</STRONG>, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might 
not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause <STRONG>a skin of 
blackness</STRONG> to come upon them. (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21)</P>
<P>In 1981, in an attempt to minimize the book’s racial teaching about people 
being cursed with a dark skin, the LDS Church changed the Book of Mormon promise 
that in the last days the Lamanites who converted to the gospel would revert to 
being “white” (2 Nephi 30:6). This verse used to promise the descendants of Lehi 
that upon conversion they would become “a <STRONG>white</STRONG> and a 
delightsome people.” However, this was changed in 1981 to read “a 
<STRONG>pure</STRONG> and a delightsome people.”</P>
<P>Now they have introduced additional changes to further obscure the Lamanite’s 
cursed skin color. The heading for 2 Nephi, chapter 5, has been reworded. In the 
1981 edition it read:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are cursed, 
<STRONG>receive a skin of blackness</STRONG>, and become a scourge unto the 
Nephites</EM>. (1981 heading for 2 Nephi 5)</P>
<P>It now reads:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from 
the presence of the Lord, are cursed, and become a scourge unto the 
Nephites</EM>. (2013 heading for 2 Nephi 5)</P>
<P>Notice the removal of “skin of blackness.” The heading for Mormon, chapter 5, 
was also reworked. It used to read:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Book of Mormon shall come forth to 
convince all Israel that Jesus is the Christ—<STRONG>The Lamanites shall be a 
dark, filthy, and loathsome people</STRONG>—They shall receive the gospel from 
the Gentiles in the latter days</EM>. (Book of Mormon, 1981 Introduction, Mormon 
5)</P>
<P>The 2013 edition has reworded the introduction to this chapter to eliminate 
the derogatory description of the Lamanites:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>The Book of Mormon will come forth to convince all Israel 
that Jesus is the Christ—Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites will be 
scattered, and the Spirit will cease to strive with them—They will receive the 
gospel from the Gentiles in the latter days</EM>. (2013 Introduction, Mormon 
5)</P>
<P>However, the chapter itself still retains the original racist teaching:</P>
<P class="quote">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for this people shall be scattered, and shall 
become <STRONG>a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people,</STRONG> beyond the 
description of that which ever hath been amongst us, yea, even that which hath 
been among the Lamanites, and this because of their unbelief and idolatry. 
(Mormon 5:15)</P>
<P>In spite of these changes the Book of Mormon continues to promote racism by 
portraying “white” people as “fair and delightsome” while “dark” people are 
referred to as “cursed.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a13" 
name="ra13">[13]</A></P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Plural Marriage</P>
<P>It is interesting to see how the Book of Mormon chapter headings have been 
reworded in relation to plural wives. In Jacob, chapters 2 and 3, are verses 
dealing with marriage and polygamy. The old heading for chapter 2 read:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Men should seek riches to help their fellow 
men—<STRONG>Jacob condemns the unauthorized practice of plural 
marriage</STRONG>—The Lord delights in the chastity of women</EM>.</P>
<P>By using the word “unauthorized” the Mormon was still free to promote plural 
marriage as long as it was “authorized.” This has been reworded to avoid 
mentioning plural marriage altogether:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Men may seek riches to help their fellowmen—<STRONG>The 
Lord commands that no man among the Nephites may have more than one 
wife</STRONG>—The Lord delights in the chastity of women</EM>.</P>
<P>Regardless of the headings, Jacob 2:24, condemning David and Solomon’s plural 
wives, still contradicts <EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM> 132:1, 38, 39, where 
David and Solomon’s wives are approved by God.</P>
<P>In response to criticism of polygamy LDS members will often point out that 
Jacob 2:30 says men are to have only one wife unless the Lord commands 
otherwise, thus implying that Smith’s polygamy was approved since it was 
commanded by God. This verse would not provide a justification of Joseph Smith’s 
many marriages as the Book of Mormon verse seems to indicate that the reason God 
might command plural wives would be for purpose of procreation:</P>
<P class="quote">For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, <STRONG>raise up seed 
unto me</STRONG>, I will command my people; <STRONG>otherwise</STRONG> they 
shall hearken unto these things. (Jacob 2:30)</P>
<P>However, there is no clear evidence that Smith produced any children from his 
33+ plural wives. (Further discussion of plural marriage will be found in the 
section dealing with the <EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM>.)</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Monetary System </P>
<P>One criticism of the Book of Mormon has been the lack of evidence for coins 
in the New World. Prior to 2013, Alma 11 contained this chapter heading:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Nephite <STRONG>coinage</STRONG> set forth</EM>.</P>
<P>Evidently the LDS leaders recognize the problem of saying the Native 
Americans used coins. In trying to minimize the problem the heading has been 
changed to “The Nephite <STRONG>monetary system</STRONG> is set forth.” However 
just dropping the word “coinage” does not solve the problem. Alma 11:3 states 
that a day’s wages were “a senine of gold” or “a senum of silver, which is equal 
to a senine of gold.” Verse 4 speaks of the “names of the different 
<STRONG>pieces</STRONG> of their <STRONG>gold</STRONG>, and of their 
<STRONG>silver</STRONG>, according to their value.” This certainly paints a 
picture of a system of coins.</P>
<P>However, there is no evidence that Native Americans ever developed a monetary 
system based on gold and silver, whether one refers to it as coins or weights. 
Native American economics were based primarily on trade and agriculture. The 
Mayans traded quetzal feathers, obsidian, jade, cocoa beans, and other 
agricultural items, but did not use a “monetary system” based on gold and 
silver. They truly had a barter system.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a14" 
name="ra14">[14]</A> This would have been true of the early inhabitants in the 
eastern area of the United States as well.</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Maps</P>
<P>The LDS church announced that the new 2013 edition of their scriptures would 
include more maps. There are 14 maps relating to the Bible and 7 maps for the 
church history section. Yet there is not one map relating to the Book  of 
Mormon. The fact that they cannot identify a single location demonstrates that 
they have no concrete evidence that these people ever existed. To date there is 
not one artifact or sample of writing (independent of Joseph Smith) attributed 
to Book of Mormon people.</P>
<P>The closest thing to a map in official LDS literature is the illustration 
below that is in the 2008 edition of <EM>Book of Mormon Seminary Student Study 
Guide</EM> entitled “Possible Book of Mormon Sites (in Relation to Each Other).” 
However, at the bottom of the illustration is this warning:</P>
<P class="quote"><STRONG>Possible</STRONG> relationships of sites in the Book of 
Mormon based on <STRONG>internal</STRONG> evidence. <STRONG>No effort should be 
made to identify points on this map with any existing geographical</STRONG> 
<STRONG>location</STRONG>.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a15" 
name="ra15">[15]</A></P>

height="632"></A></P>
<P>The illustrator was very careful in making his chart so that one could not 
correlate it with a map of either North or South America.</P><A id="dc" name="dc"></A>
<P class="subheading-1">Doctrine and Covenants</P>
<P>Smith’s revelations were first published in book form in 1833 under the title 
<EM>Book of Commandments</EM>. Then in 1835 a new edition was published under 
the title <EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM>. Smith’s revelations underwent 
numerous revisions at that time, but other changes have been made since then.<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a16" 
name="ra16">[16]</A></P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Code Names</P>
<P>After the Mormons left New York and settled in Ohio and Missouri in the early 
1830’s they developed serious financial problems. Joseph Smith and several other 
leaders embarked on a number of business ventures. Mormon historians James B. 
Allen and Glen M. Leonard explain:</P>
<P class="quote">Administration of these economic affairs was complex, and in 
April 1832 the Prophet and others attempted to simplify it when they created a 
new administrative agency known as the Central Council. This council, in turn, 
immediately created the <STRONG>United Firm</STRONG> (sometimes called the 
United Order), consisting of Joseph Smith and a handful of other Church leaders 
in Ohio and Missouri. <STRONG>This was a joint-stewardship in which the members 
consecrated all their lands and business to the firm.</STRONG> They were to 
manage “all things pertaining to the bishopric” (D&amp;C 82:12), supervise the

<P>Fearing possible lawsuits, Smith masked their business plans by using code 
names for various men and locations Zion refers to Independence, Missouri) in 
several of the revelations printed in 1835. These pseudonyms were used in 
<EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM>, sections 78, 82, 92, 96, 103,104, and 105.<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a18" 
name="ra18">[18]</A> While the new heading for section 78 gives some background 
on the “United Firm,” it does not discuss the code names used in the original 
printing of the revelation:</P>
<P class="quote"><STRONG><EM>Revelatio</EM><EM>n</EM></STRONG> <EM>given through 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 1, 1832. On that day, the 
Prophet and other leaders had assembled to <STRONG>discuss Church 
business</STRONG>. This revelation originally instructed the Prophet, Sidney 
Rigdon, and Newel K. Whitney to travel to Missouri and <STRONG>organize the 
Church’s mercantile and publishing endeavors by creating a “firm” that would 
oversee these efforts, generating funds for the establishment of Zion</STRONG> 
and for the benefit of the poor. This firm, known as the <STRONG>United 
Firm</STRONG>, was organized in April 1832 and <STRONG>disbanded</STRONG> in 
1834 (see section 82). Sometime after its dissolution, under the direction of 
Joseph Smith, the phrase “the affairs of the storehouse for the poor” 
<STRONG>replaced</STRONG> “mercantile and publishing establishments” in the 
revelation, and the word “order” replaced the word “firm.”</EM> (2013 
<EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM>, Introduction to Section 78)</P>
<P>Below is an example of the code names used in the 1835 <EM>Doctrine and 
Covenants</EM>:</P>
<P class="quote">The Lord spake unto <STRONG>Enoch</STRONG>, saying: Hearken 
unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are ordained unto the high priesthood of 
my church, who have assembled yourselves together .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in other 
words, let my servant <STRONG>Ahashdah</STRONG> and my servant 
<STRONG>Gazelam</STRONG> or <STRONG>Enoch</STRONG>, and my servant 
<STRONG>Pelagoram</STRONG> sit in council with the saints which are in Zion. 
(1835 <EM>D&amp;C</EM> 75:1-2)</P>
<P>However, the 2013 edition of the same passage reads:</P>
<P class="quote">The Lord spake unto <STRONG>Joseph Smith, Jun</STRONG>., 
saying: Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are ordained unto the high 
priesthood of my church, who have assembled yourselves 
together.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in other words, let my servant <STRONG>Newel K. 
Whitney</STRONG> and my servant <STRONG>Joseph Smith, Jun</STRONG>., and my 
servant <STRONG>Sidney Rigdon</STRONG> sit in council with the saints which are 
in Zion. (<EM>D&amp;C</EM> 78:1, 9)</P>
<P>The code names were obviously an attempt to keep the public from knowing the 
leaders’ financial plans.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a19" 
name="ra19">[19]</A> However, even though established by revelation, Smith’s 
United Firm failed and the church went further into debt.</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Civil War Prophecy</P>
<P>Section 87 of the <EM>D&amp;C</EM> has often been put forward as a proof of 
Joseph Smith’s prophetic ability, predicting the civil war twenty-nine years 
before the event.</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Revelation and prophecy on war, given through Joseph Smith 
the Prophet, at or near Kirtland, Ohio, December 25, 1832. This section was 
received at a time when the brethren were reflecting and reasoning upon African 
slavery on the American continent and the slavery of the children of men 
throughout the world</EM>. (Sec. 87)</P>
<P>However, research has demonstrated that newspapers of the day had already 
announced the pending secession of South Carolina, making civil war a likely 
outcome. Smith was just putting into words the current fears of the nation.<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a20" 
name="ra20">[20]</A> The new heading for this revelation seems to concede the 
point:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Revelation and prophecy on war, given through Joseph Smith 
the Prophet, at or near Kirtland, Ohio, December 25, 1832. At this time disputes 
in the United States over <STRONG>slavery</STRONG> and <STRONG>South Carolina’s 
nullification of federal tariffs</STRONG> were prevalent</EM>. (Sec. 87)</P>
<P>When South Carolina backed down from secession the 1832 revelation was 
evidently tucked away and not published until 1851 in England as part of the 
<EM>Pearl of Great Price</EM>. It was not placed in the <EM>Doctrine and 
Covenants</EM> until 1876, years after the Civil War had ended and the Mormons 
felt comfortable claiming it as a revelation.</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Plural Marriage and Section 132</P>
<P>The new introduction to <EM>D&amp;C</EM> section 132 states:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at 
Nauvoo, Illinois, <STRONG>recorded</STRONG> July 12, 1843, relating to the new 
and everlasting covenant, including the eternity of the marriage covenant and 
<STRONG>the principle of plural marriage</STRONG>. Although the revelation was 
recorded in 1843, evidence indicates that <STRONG>some</STRONG> of the 
principles involved in this revelation were known by the Prophet as early as 
<STRONG>1831</STRONG>. See Official Declaration 1</EM>.</P>
<P>Thus the LDS Church now concedes that Smith was teaching plural marriage 
prior to July of 1843 but doesn’t explain which 
“principles”wereknownasearlyas1831. At that time Joseph Smith had given a 
revelation commanding missionaries be sent to convert and intermarry with the 
American Indians. However, since the men who were sent on the mission were 
already married, it is obvious that they would have been practicing plural 
marriage.</P>
<P>While the revelation was not published at the time, it was mentioned in the 
<EM>Ohio Star</EM> on December 8, 1831. The purpose of marrying the Native 
Americans seems to have been aimed at gaining access to the Indian reservations. 
Ezra Booth wrote:</P>
<P class="quote">In addition to this, and to co-operate with it, it has been 
made known by revelation, that it will be pleasing to the Lord, should they [LDS 
missionaries] form a matrimonial alliance with the Natives, and by this means 
the Elders, who comply with the thing so pleasing to the Lord, and for which the 
Lord has promised to bless those who do it abundantly, gain a residence in the 
Indian territory, independent of the [Indian] agent. It has been made known to 
one, who has left his wife in the state of N.Y. that he is entirely free from 
his wife, and he is at liberty to take him a wife from among the Lamanites.<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a21" 
name="ra21">[21]</A></P>
<P>The 1831 revelation shows that it relates to marrying Native Americans to 
fulfill the Book of Mormon promise that in the last days the Indians’ skin color 
would be changed to “white.” The revelation states:</P>
<P class="quote">Verily, I say unto you, that the wisdom of man, in his fallen 
state, knoweth not the purposes and the privileges of my holy priesthood, but ye 
shall know when ye receive a fulness by reason of the anointing. For it is my 
will, that in time, ye should take unto you <STRONG>wives of the Lamanites and 
Nephites, that their posterity may become white, delightsome</STRONG> and just, 
for even now their females are more virtuous than the gentiles.<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a22" name="ra22">[22]</A></P>
<P>While it does not directly address the issue of plural marriage the fact that 
married men were commanded to take Native American wives demonstrates that it 
would have been the logical outcome. W. W. Phelps, early LDS leader, was present 
when the revelation was given and later asked Smith about it:</P>
<P class="quote">About three years after this was given, I asked brother Joseph 
[Smith, Jr.] privately, how “we,” that were mentioned in the revelation could 
take wives from the “natives”—as we were all married men? He replied instantly 
“In the[e] same manner that Abraham took Hagar and Katurah [Keturah]; and Jacob 
took Rachel Bilhah, and Zilpah: by revelation—the saints of the Lord are always 
directed by revelation.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a23" 
name="ra23">[23]</A></P>
<P>If the Mormons are going to claim that there was some other 1831 revelation 
on marriage they should produce it. To date, the Native American revelation is 
the only one known.</P>
<P>The next hint of Smith knowing some of the “principles” of eternal marriage 
relates to his association with Fanny Alger, a young woman living with the 
Smiths in Kirtland, Ohio. Historian Todd Compton lists Fanny Alger as Joseph 
Smith’s first plural wife, giving the time of their marriage as early 1833.<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a24" 
name="ra24">[24]</A> While there is evidence of an affair between them, proof of 
an actual marriage ceremony is more sketchy, relying on a late recollection of 
Levi Hancock.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a25" 
name="ra25">[25]</A> If Smith was privately married to Fanny, Oliver Cowdery, 
one of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, was not aware of it. He wrote to his 
brother, Warren, in 1838 accusing Smith of having a “dirty, nasty, filthy 
affair” with Fanny Alger.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a26" 
name="ra26">[26]</A></P>
<P>To calm rumors regarding Fanny’s relationship with Joseph, the church quickly 
added a section on marriage to the 1835 edition of the <EM>Doctrine and 
Covenants</EM>, which declared, “Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been 
reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy; we declare that we 
believe, that one man should have one wife .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a27" name="ra27">[27]</A></P>
<P>Traditionally scholars have listed Smith’s first plural wife as Louisa 
Beaman, in Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1841. By 1842 rumors were circulating that Smith 
was secretly taking additional wives. We now know that Smith’s next several 
wives were already married to other men, which would have provided a cover for 
his activities.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a28" 
name="ra28">[28]</A></P>
<P>In 1842 John C. Bennett, former mayor of Nauvoo and confidant of Joseph 
Smith, published his expose, <EM>History of the Saints</EM>, charging Smith with 
secretly practicing polygamy. In answer to Bennett’s book, in August of 1842 the 
LDS newspaper <EM>Times and Seasons</EM> denounced his charges of plural 
marriage as “base falsehoods and misrepresentations.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a29" 
name="ra29">[29]</A> However, history confirms Bennett’s charge. Historians now 
concede that Smith had at least 34 wives by the time of his death in 1844.<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a30" 
name="ra30">[30]</A></P>
<P>In 1843, after Joseph Smith had secretly married about two dozen women in 
plural marriage,<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a31" 
name="ra31">[31]</A> and had received strong opposition from his wife Emma, 
Smith’s brother Hyrum implored Joseph to record his revelation. Hyrum was 
convinced that he could take it to Emma and convince her that plural marriage 
was ordained of God. The first verse of section 132 explains that the purpose of 
the revelation was to answer Smith’s questions about “Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as touching <STRONG>the principle 
and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines</STRONG>.” Verse 4 is 
very emphatic that those who have had this revelation given to them must obey it 
or be “damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter 
into my glory.” Verse 52 specifically commands Emma to accept the women Smith 
had already married:</P>
<P class="quote">And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, <STRONG>receive all those 
that have been given unto my servant Joseph</STRONG>, and who are virtuous and 
pure before me; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to 
abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But if she will not 
abide this commandment <STRONG>she shall be destroyed</STRONG>, saith the Lord; 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (<EM>D&amp;C</EM> 132:52)</P>
<P>When Hyrum returned from showing Emma the revelation he told Joseph “he had 
never received a more severe talking to in his life.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a32" 
name="ra32">[32]</A> Thus we see that the whole reason the revelation was 
committed to paper was to convince Emma about plural marriage. While Emma Smith 
probably did not know the extent of Smith’s plural marriages at the time she was 
shown the revelation, she was well aware of the issue.</P>
<P>Today the church is trying to present section 132 as mainly dealing with 
their concept of eternal marriage, with polygamy being only a side issue. 
History shows that it was just the opposite. For instance, Joseph F. Smith, 
nephew of Joseph Smith, apostle and later president of the LDS Church, preached 
in 1878 that the practice of plural marriage was necessary to achieve the 
highest exaltation in heaven. He also emphasized that Joseph Smith only entered 
into plural marriage after “an angel of God, with a drawn sword, stood before 
him and commanded that he should enter into the practice of that principle, or 
he should be utterly destroyed.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a33" 
name="ra33">[33]</A> Lorenzo Snow, fifth president of the LDS Church, gave the 
following information in an 1869 affidavit:</P>
<P class="quote">In the month of April, 1843, I returned from my European 
mission. A few days after my arrival at Nauvoo, when at President Joseph Smith’s 
house, he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. explained to me the <STRONG>doctrine of plurality of 
wives</STRONG>; he said that the Lord had revealed it unto him, and commanded 
him to have women sealed to him as wives; that he foresaw the trouble that would 
follow, and sought to turn away from the commandment; that <STRONG>an angel from 
heaven then appeared before him with a drawn sword, threatening him with 
destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment</STRONG>.<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a34" name="ra34">[34]</A></P>
<P>The early LDS Church leaders understood that section 132 of the <EM>Doctrine 
and Covenants</EM> commanded plural marriage. It was not just a side issue to 
eternal marriage, it was the key issue. Emma wasn’t sealed in marriage to Joseph 
until May 28, 1843, at which time Smith had already been sealed to approximately 
two dozen women. In order to receive her eternal sealing to Smith, Emma had to 
accept Joseph’s plural marriages.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a35" 
name="ra35">[35]</A></P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">The Manifesto — Declaration 1</P>
<P>In 1890 eighty-three-year-old LDS President Wilford Woodruff issued his 
famous Manifesto, counseling the Mormons to forsake plural marriage. This is 
printed in the <EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM> as Declaration 1. While the 
Manifesto is presented as the results of a revelation, no actual revelation has 
been printed. The new heading for Declaration 1 reads:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>The Bible and the Book of Mormon teach that monogamy is 
God’s standard for marriage unless He declares otherwise (see 2&nbsp;Samuel 
12:7–8 and Jacob 2:27, 30). Following a revelation to Joseph Smith, the 
<STRONG>practice of plural marriage</STRONG> was instituted among Church members 
in the <STRONG>early 1840s </STRONG>(see section 132). From the 1860s to the 
1880s, the United States Government passed laws to make this <STRONG>religious 
practice illegal</STRONG>. These laws were eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme 
Court. After receiving revelation, President Wilford Woodruff issued the 
following Manifesto, which was accepted by the Church as authoritative and 
binding on October 6, 1890. This led to the end of the <STRONG>practice</STRONG> 
of plural marriage in the Church</EM>.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a36" 
name="ra36">[36]</A></P>
<P>This carefully worded statement is misleading in several areas.</P>
<P>1. Not only does the Bible and Book of Mormon teach monogamy, but from 1835 
until 1876 the <EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM> contained a section that taught 
monogamy and denounced polygamy as a crime.</P>
<P class="quote">Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the 
crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man 
should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death, 
when either is at liberty to marry again.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a37" 
name="ra37">[37]</A></P>
<P>In 1876 this section was dropped from the canon and replaced by section 
132.</P>
<P>2. The new heading implies that once plural marriage was made illegal the LDS 
Church gave up the practice. Ironically, polygamy was against the law in 
Illinois when the early Mormons began practicing it there.<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a38" name="ra38">[38]</A> This was 
the reason for its great secrecy and the adamant denials of the doctrine and 
practice by Joseph Smith. Preaching just one month prior to his murder, Joseph 
Smith gave this denial of polygamy:</P>
<P class="quote">What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing 
adultery, and <STRONG>having seven wives</STRONG>, when I can only find 
<STRONG>one</STRONG>. I am the same man, and as innocent as I was fourteen years 
ago; and I can prove them all perjurers.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a39" 
name="ra39">[39]</A></P>
<P>However, research shows that he had at least 34 wives at that time.<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a40" name="ra40">[40]</A></P>
<P>Historian Richard S. Van Wagoner provides the following information about the 
Illinois law:</P>
<P class="quote"><STRONG>Polygamy, a criminal act under the 1833 Illinois 
Anti-bigamy Laws</STRONG>, was so unacceptable to monogamous nineteenth-century 
American society that Smith could introduce it only in <STRONG>absolute 
secrecy</STRONG>. Despite Smith’s explicit denials of plural marriage, stories 
of “spiritual wifery” had continued to spread.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a41" 
name="ra41">[41]</A></P>
<P>3. The heading for the Manifesto refers to polygamy as a “practice,” not a 
doctrine. The early Mormons risked prison for plural marriage because they 
believed it was a doctrine, and failure to practice it would keep one from 
exaltation. Preaching in 1866, President Brigham Young declared:</P>
<P class="quote">The only men who become Gods, even the Sons of God, are those 
who enter into polygamy.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a42" 
name="ra42">[42]</A></P>
<P>Joseph Smith told Heber C. Kimball that if he didn’t enter into polygamy “he 
would lose his apostleship and be damned.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a43" 
name="ra43">[43]</A></P>
<P>4. The new heading states that the issuing of the Manifesto 
“<STRONG>led</STRONG> to the end of the practice of plural marriage in the 
Church.” Notice that it says <EM>led</EM> to the end, not that polygamy was 
actually ended in 1890. What most readers will not know is that after 1890 over 
two hundred LDS apostles and leaders continued to take plural wives.<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a44" name="ra44">[44]</A> LDS 
scholar B. Carmon Hardy observed:</P>
<P class="quote">The total of 262 post-Manifesto plural marriages found and 
described in the list [at the back of his book] makes it clear that a strong 
commitment to the doctrine continued past the turn of the century.<A class="super-1" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a45" name="ra45">[45]</A></P>
<P>Also, the statements following Declaration 1 show that the main reason plural 
marriage was abandoned was simply due to the fear of legal action against the 
church and possible arrest of the church leaders, not that it was no longer 
considered a doctrine.</P>
<P>5. By stating that “monogamy is God’s standard for marriage” and that the 
Manifesto “led to the end of the practice of plural marriage in the Church” the 
church seems to be suggesting that plural marriage is no longer a part of LDS 
beliefs. However, after the death of a wife a Mormon man is able to be 
married/sealed again in the temple to a new wife. According to LDS statements 
this would result in plural marriage in heaven as the man had two women sealed 
to him while on earth.</P>
<P>This doctrine was affirmed in October of 2007 at the funeral for the second 
wife of President Howard W. Hunter, the fourteenth President of the LDS Church. 
The <EM>Deseret News</EM> reported:</P>
<P class="quote"><STRONG>President Hinckley affirmed the eternal nature of the 
marriage between Sister [Inis] Hunter and the former church president</STRONG>, 
whose first wife, Claire Jeffs, died after a long battle with Alzheimer’s 
disease and is now buried beside him in the Salt Lake Cemetery.</P>
<P class="quote">Inis Hunter “will now be laid to rest on the other side,” he 
said. “<STRONG>They were sealed under the authority of the Holy Melchizedek 
Priesthood for time and for all eternity</STRONG>,” he said, recalling the 
marriage ceremony he performed for them in the Salt Lake Temple in April 1990.<A 
class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a46" 
name="ra46">[46]</A></P>
<P>Another example of plural sealings is Apostle Russell M. Nelson’s marriage in 
2006 to a BYU professor. The <EM>BYU NewsNet</EM> for April 7, 2006, announced 
the temple marriage of Apostle Nelson, age 81, to Wendy Watson. His first wife 
died in February of 2005 and this was the first marriage for his new wife. This 
would mean, according to LDS beliefs, that Nelson has two wives sealed to him 
for eternity.</P>
<P>Harold B. Lee, the eleventh president of the church, also remarried after his 
wife’s death and was sealed to another woman and was looking forward to a 
polygamous relationship in heaven. He, in fact, wrote a poem in which he 
reflected that his second wife, Joan, would join his first wife, Fern, as his 
eternal wives:</P>
<P class="quote-timesfont-noindent"><EM>My lovely Joan was sent to me: So Joan 
joins Fern</EM><BR><EM>That three might be, more fitted for eternity.<BR>“O 
Heavenly Father, my thanks to thee”<BR></EM>(<EM>Deseret News 1974 Church 
Almanac</EM>, p. 17)</P>
<P>After being widowed, Apostle Dallin Oaks remarried in the temple and believes 
he will be married eternally to both women. In 2002 he commented on his second 
sealing:</P>
<P class="quote">When I was 66, my wife June died of cancer. Two years later—a 
year and a half ago—I married [in the LDS temple] Kristen McMain, <STRONG>the 
eternal companion</STRONG> who now stands at my side. (Dallin Oaks, “Timing,” 
speech delivered at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, January 29, 2002)</P>
<P>According to LDS doctrine, these men will have their faithful wives and 
children with them in the resurrection, which would mean they will be living 
polygamy in the Celestial Kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus we see that the doctrine and practice of plural marriage has not been 
abandoned, but only delayed until the afterlife.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a47" 
name="ra47">[47]</A> It seems the LDS Church simply wants to keep it out of the 
public eye for better public relations and fear of being identified with 
polygamist splinter groups.</P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">Declaration 2</P>
<P>The new heading for Declaration 2, granting priesthood to blacks, reads:</P>
<P class="quote"><EM>The Book of Mormon teaches that “all are alike unto God,” 
including “black and white, bond and free, male and female” (2 Nephi 26:33). 
Throughout the history of the Church, people of every race and ethnicity in many 
countries <STRONG>have been baptized</STRONG> and have lived as faithful members 
of the Church. During Joseph Smith’s lifetime, <STRONG>a few black male</STRONG> 
members of the Church were ordained to the priesthood. Early in its history, 
Church leaders <STRONG>stopped conferring the priesthood on black males of 
African descent</STRONG>. Church records offer <STRONG>no clear 
insights</STRONG> into the origins of this practice. Church leaders believed 
that <STRONG>a revelation from God was needed to alter this practice</STRONG> 
and prayerfully sought guidance. The <STRONG>revelation</STRONG> came to Church 
President Spencer W. Kimball and was affirmed to other Church leaders in the 
Salt Lake Temple on June 1, 1978. The revelation removed all restrictions with 
regard to race that once applied to the priesthood.</EM></P>
<P>While the church concedes that a few blacks were ordained to the priesthood 
during Joseph Smith’s lifetime, they do not explain that this did not grant 
blacks access to the temple rites in Nauvoo. For example, Elijah Abel, one of 
the earliest blacks to receive the priesthood, was never granted temple access, 
even though he advanced to the level of a Seventy and went on a mission for the 
church.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a48" name="ra48">[48]</A> 
Jane Manning, a faithful Mormon and maid in the Smith household, begged the 
church leaders to allow her to be sealed in the temple, but the request was 
denied.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a49" name="ra49">[49]</A></P>
<P>Notice also that the church claims “no clear insights” into why priesthood 
was denied to blacks. This is a blatant dismissal of over 100 years of racial 
statements by their prophets and apostles. Prior to 1978 the LDS leaders seem to 
have been quite clear as to the reason. Preaching in 1859, at the October 
Conference of the LDS Church, Brigham Young declared:</P>
<P class="quote">Cain slew his brother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the Lord put a mark 
upon him, which is the <STRONG>flat nose and black 
skin</STRONG>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How long is that race to endure the 
<STRONG>dreadful curse</STRONG> that is upon them? That curse will remain upon 
them, and <STRONG>they never can hold the Priesthood or share in it until all 
the other descendants of Adam have received the promises</STRONG> and enjoyed 
the blessings of the Priesthood and the keys thereof. Until the <STRONG>last 
ones</STRONG> of the residue of Adam’s children are brought up to that 
favourable position, the children of Cain <STRONG>cannot</STRONG> receive the 
first ordinances of the Priesthood. They were the first that were cursed, and 
they will be the <STRONG>last</STRONG> from whom the curse will be removed.<A

<P>Mormon blogger Joanna Brooks gives the following analysis of the new 
heading:</P>
<P class="quote">Church leaders have long maintained public ambiguity about the 
history of the ban and its end; they have rarely acknowledged the ordination of 
early African-American Mormons nor have they cited anti-racist teaching in the 
Book of Mormon in connection with the Church’s own troubled history on race. The 
new heading historicizes the ban (suggesting the influence of a robust Church 
History department) and depicts it as a contradiction to the original impulses 
of the faith, not corrected until 1978. The heading does, some commentators have 
noted, offer continuing cover to Brigham Young, whose on-the-record racist 
statements to the Utah legislature suggest his influence in the evolution of a 
non-ordination policy. Commentators also note the absence of reference to the 
fact that black women were not historically admitted to LDS temple worship until 
the 1978 announcement.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a51" 
name="ra51">[51]</A></P>
<P class="underlinesubheading">History of the Church</P>
<P>Other interesting deletions from the <EM>Doctrine and Covenants</EM> include 
all the references to the <EM>History of the Church</EM> whose authorship is 
attributed to Joseph Smith.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a52" 
name="ra52">[52]</A> This leaves the reader with no idea where to find further 
information on the events that led up to the revelations. On the official LDS 
web site, in a question and answer section relating to the recent adjustments to 
the LDS scriptures, we read:</P>
<P class="quote">While <STRONG>foundational</STRONG> for our&nbsp; understanding 
of early Latter-day&nbsp; Saint history, the <STRONG><EM>History&nbsp; of the 
Church</EM></STRONG> contains historical errors about some sections of the 
Doctrine and Covenants and is <STRONG>inaccessible to most Church 
members</STRONG>. In addition, the revised section headings rely on other 
sources, including the Manuscript History of the Church, early manuscript 
revelation books, and other sources that are reproduced in the Joseph Smith 
Papers. Quotations from the Manuscript History of the Church and the <EM>History 
of the Church</EM> are <STRONG>collectively</STRONG> referred to in section 
headings as <STRONG>Joseph Smith’s history</STRONG>.<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a53" 
name="ra53">[53]</A></P>
<P>First, it should be noted that the reason the <EM>History of the Church</EM> 
is “inaccessible” is because the church has discontinued printing it. While 
copies are still available in various libraries, most members do not have these 
volumes. Second, by simply citing the information as coming from a collection of 
writings referred to as “Joseph Smith’s history” one is left with no idea as to 
the specific source. The <EM>Manuscript History of the Church</EM> is comprised 
of about 2400 pages and the <EM>Documentary History of the Church</EM> spans 
some 3000 pages. To say that a certain statement or quote can be found somewhere 
therein is like telling a person that the source can be found in the 
library.</P><A id="conclusion1" name="conclusion1"></A>
<P class="subheading-1">Conclusion</P>
<P>While some of the new headings in the LDS scriptures provide additional 
information, there is still an obscuring of troubling historical details.</P>
<P>Writing in 2012 reporter Peggy Fletcher Stack commented on the crisis faced 
by LDS members when they encounter critical information:</P>
<P class="quote">Surprised by what they find so easily online, more and more 
members of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are 
encountering crises of faith. Some even leave the fold and, feeling betrayed, 
join the ranks of Mormon opponents.</P>
<P class="quote">It’s a growing problem, acknowledges LDS general authority 
Marlin Jensen, the faith’s outgoing church historian, and one Mormon leaders are 
working to confront.</P>
<P class="quote">“Never before have we had this information age, with social 
networking and bloggers publishing unvetted points of view,” Jensen said in an 
interview Monday. “The church is concerned about misinformation and distorted 
information, but we are doing better and trying harder to get our story told in 
an accurate way.”<A class="super-1" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#a54" 
name="ra54">[54]</A></P>
<P>Unfortunately, the LDS Church is the main culprit in the spread of “distorted 
information.” As more and more people seek information on the Internet and from 
books not published by the LDS Church, the leaders will need to do a better job 
of candidly addressing its problematic history.</P>

<P class="subheading-6">What Happened to the Office of LDS Church Patriarch?</P>
<P>On April 6, 2013 the <EM>Salt Lake Tribune</EM> announced the death of Eldred 
G. Smith, at the age of 106, the longest- serving LDS General Authority and last 
to hold the position of Church Patriarch. He was also the great-great-grandson 
of Joseph Smith’s brother Hyrum. Originally the office was to be passed down 
through the Smith lineage, but the LDS Church dropped the position in 1979, when 
Eldred G. Smith was retired.<A class="super-2" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#b1" 
name="rb1">[1]</A> The article brought attention to the often ignored problem of 
the demise of a church priesthood office supposedly established by revelation.<A 
class="super-2" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#b2" 
name="rb2">[2]</A></P>
<P>Joseph Smith claimed through revelation to re-establish the ancient order of 
“Patriarch,” patterned after the father’s blessings given in the Bible (see Gen. 
27 and Gen. 49). Unlike the Old Testament blessings given by a father on his 
deathbed to his sons, today the LDS blessings are given by non-relatives to 
various members of the church as a sort of road map for their lives and declares 
their lineage through one of the tribes of Israel.</P>
<P>Mormonism claims that the designation “Patriarch” is the same as 
“Evangelist.” LDS Apostle Bruce R. McConkie wrote:</P>
<P class="quote">Having <STRONG>lost</STRONG> the true knowledge of the 
priesthood and its offices, and <STRONG>knowing nothing of patriarch blessings 
as a necessary part of church administration</STRONG>, the 
<STRONG>false</STRONG> traditions of the sectarian world have applied the 
designation <STRONG>evangelist</STRONG> to <STRONG>traveling preachers</STRONG>, 
missionaries, and revivalists. The sectarian theory is that evangelists travel 
to spread the gospel.<A class="super-2" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#b3" 
name="rb3">[3]</A></P>
<P>However, there is absolutely nothing in the New Testament about the need of 
Patriarchs in the church. Also, there is nothing in the Bible to indicate that 
an evangelist was ever known as a Patriarch. The word “evangelist” comes from 
the Greek word “evangel” which means “the good news.” Thus an evangelist is one 
who proclaims “the good news.” Paul wrote to Timothy “Preach the word; 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do the work of an evangelist.” (2 Timothy 4:2, 5)</P>
<P>Smith originally ordained his father to the office of Church Patriarch, who 
was later succeeded by Hyrum Smith, Joseph’s older brother. The <EM>Doctrine and 
Covenants</EM>, sec. 124:91-92, states: “let my servant William be appointed, 
ordained, and anointed, as counselor unto my servant Joseph, in the room of my 
servant Hyrum, that <STRONG>my servant Hyrum may take the office of Priesthood 
and Patriarch</STRONG>, which was appointed unto him by his father, by blessing 
and also <STRONG>by right</STRONG>; That from henceforth he shall hold the 
<STRONG>keys of the patriarchal blessings</STRONG> upon the heads of all my 
people, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</P>
<P>Prior to 1979 this office was part of the LDS Church General Authorities and 
held by direct descendants of Smith.</P>
<P>The <EM>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</EM>, vol. 3, under 
<STRONG>PATRIARCH</STRONG>, explains:</P>
<P class="quote"><STRONG>Before 1979, Patriarch to the Church was a Church 
officer</STRONG> whose chief duty was to confer patriarchal blessings on Church 
members who generally did not have the service of stake Patriarchs readily 
available to them. The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that <STRONG>an 
“evangelist”</STRONG> (as in Ephesians 4:11) <STRONG>is a “patriarch”</STRONG> 
(TPJS, p. 151); that is, he confers the blessings of a patriarch upon members of 
the Church. Patriarchs are currently ordained in individual stakes of the 
Church, <STRONG>but for many years there was a patriarch to the entire 
Church</STRONG>. He was considered <STRONG>one of the General 
Authorities</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Today the LDS Church no longer has the office of Patriarch as part of the 
General Authorities. Currently one man in each stake, or diocese, of the church 
is set apart as the local Patriarch. But this is a complete reversal of the 
original office. Since this top leadership position was claimed to be 
established by revelation one is left to wonder why it was removed. Evidently 
the LDS Church leaders were concerned about continuing an office that required 
one to be a Smith descendant. Again Mormons are faced with the problem of 
current policy overriding past revelation. If it required a revelation to end 
the ban on blacks holding the LDS priesthood, why wouldn’t it require a 
revelation to nullify the office of Church Patriarch which was established by 
revelation? (For more information on this, read <EM>Lost Legacy: The Mormon 
Office of Presiding Patriarch</EM>, by Irene Bates and E. Gary Smith, University 
of Illinois Press.)</P>

<P class="notextindent">uring his appearance with Ravi Zacharias in the Mormon 
Tabernacle on November 14, 2004, Fuller Seminary President Richard Mouw 
apologized on behalf of evangelicals for “bearing false witness” against 
Mormons.</P>
<P></P>
<P>When challenged about his remarks, Mouw sent out an e-mail identifying places 
where he felt evangelicals had misrepresented Mormon teaching. Among these was 
the claim that “Mormonism teaches that God was once a human being like us, and 
we can become gods just like God is now,”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c2" 
name="rc2">[2]</A> a belief, Mouw goes on to assure us, that has “no functioning 
place in present-day Mormon doctrine.” As anyone familiar with Mormonism will 
immediately recognize, Mouw’s words allude to the famous couplet coined by the 
fifth LDS Church President Lorenzo Snow:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">As man now is, God once was;<BR>  As God now is, man 
may be.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c3" name="rc3">[3]</A></P>
<P>Is Mouw correct in saying that the teaching contained in this couplet no 
longer has any functioning place in present-day Mormonism? In trying to answer 
this question, we must begin by looking at where Snow’s couplet came from and 
why it caught on as an important summary of the Mormon doctrinal system.</P><A 
id="II" name="II"></A>
<P class="centerboldtopmargin">II. The Origins of Snow’s Couplet</P>
<P>In May 1836 Lorenzo Snow visited Kirtland, Ohio, where his sister Eliza R. 
Snow had moved the previous year after converting to Mormonism. At a blessing 
meeting in the Kirtland Temple, Snow met Joseph Smith Sr. (the father of the 
Mormon Prophet) who predicted that he would soon be converted to the LDS faith. 
Smith Sr. went on to make the astonishing prediction that afterward Snow would 
“become as great as you can possibly wish—EVEN AS GREAT AS GOD.”<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c4" name="rc4">[4]</A> Snow was 
baptized two weeks later.</P>
<P>Snow was unable to make anything of this remarkable prediction until shortly 
before embarking on a mission to England in the spring of 1840. He reports that 
one day as he sat listening to Elder H. G. Sherwood’s explanation of the parable 
of the laborers in the vineyard (Matt 20:1–16),</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">the Spirit of the Lord rested mightily upon me—the 
eyes of my understanding were opened, and I saw as clear as the sun at noonday, 
with wonder and astonishment, the pathway of God and man. I formed the following 
couplet which expresses the revelation, as it was shown me, and explains Father 
Smith’s dark saying to me at a blessing meeting in the Kirtland Temple, prior to 
my baptism, as previously mentioned in my first interview with the 
Patriarch.</P>
<P class="quotedouble-noindent">As man now is, God once was:<BR>  As God now is, 
man may be.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c5" 
name="rc5">[5]</A></P>
<P>At first Snow did not share his couplet with anyone besides his sister Eliza, 
and Brigham Young, with whom he served in England. But in January of 1843, after 
returning from his mission, Snow mentioned it to the Prophet Joseph Smith, who 
said to him: “Brother Snow, that is true gospel doctrine, and it is a revelation 
from God to you.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c6" 
name="rc6">[6]</A></P><A id="III" name="III"></A>
<P class="centerboldtopmargin">III. The Couplet and the Prophet Joseph Smith</P>
<P>1. <EM>The King Follett Discourse</EM>. On 7 April 1844 Joseph Smith provided 
public confirmation to the theology of</P>
<P>Snow’s couplet in the famous King Follett Discourse. This is clearly seen in 
the following excerpts:</P>
<P class="quote">God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and 
sits enthroned in yonder heavens! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am going to tell you how God 
came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all 
eternity. I will refute that idea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is the first 
principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God, and to 
know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another, and that 
he was once a man like us; yea, that God himself, the Father of us all, dwelt on 
an earth, the same as Jesus Christ himself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you have got to learn 
how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all 
Gods have done before you, namely, by going from one small degree to another, 
and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation 
to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to 
dwell in everlasting burnings, and to sit in glory, as do those who sit 
enthroned in everlasting power.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c7" 
name="rc7">[7]</A></P>
<P class="notextindent">The relation between the Prophet’s teaching here and his 
own revelation did not escape Lorenzo Snow’s notice. According to LeRoi C. Snow, 
Lorenzo Snow, in his own copy of the <EM>Times and Seasons</EM>, “which I now 
have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. drew more particular attention, with his own indelible 
pencil, to this part of the Prophet’s King Follett sermon than to any other 
reference in all the six volumes.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c8" 
name="rc8">[8]</A></P>
<P>As the King Follett Discourse unfolds, it becomes clear that the Prophet 
Joseph Smith expected his followers to treat what he was saying there with 
utmost seriousness. Earlier, he had identified as the object of the sermon “to 
find out the character of the only wise and true God, and what kind of a being 
he is.” “But if I fail to do it,” he went on to say, “it becomes my duty to 
renounce all further pretensions to revelations and inspirations, or to be a 
prophet; and I should be like the rest of the world—a false teacher.”<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c9" name="rc9">[9]</A> Yet after 
this he goes on to sound a note of confidence, even applying language used of 
Jesus to himself: “I will prove that the world is wrong, by showing what God is 
. .&nbsp;. for I speak as one having authority” (see Matt 7:29).<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c10" name="rc10">[10]</A></P>
<P>He thus imposes on his listeners the conclusion they must draw if he turns 
out to be wrong about what he says about God in the King Follett Discourse. They 
are to consider him a “false teacher,” and approve of his renouncing “all 
further pretensions to revelations and inspirations, or to be a prophet.” 
Another way of saying this is that if by any defensible standard, Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God, then the King Follett Discourse is the product of 
prophetic inspiration. The comfortable option of continuing to consider Smith a 
true prophet and the King Follett Discourse mere speculation is not an option 
Smith himself was willing to leave open.</P>
<P>2. <EM>Joseph Smith’s last public discourse</EM>. In his last public sermon, 
given on 16 June 1844, Joseph Smith again turns to the subject of the history of 
God. This time he offers what he felt sure was biblical support for the idea 
that God the Father had a father. He found it in the language of the King James 
Version’s translation of Rev 1:6: “And hath made us kings and priests <EM>unto 
God and his Father</EM> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [italics added],” in accordance with 
which, he says, there clearly exists “a God above the Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c11" 
name="rc11">[11]</A></P>
<P>Smith was incorrect in seeing this as the true implication of the passage, a 
better translation being “unto his [Jesus’] God and Father” (see, e.g., NIV). 
This he seemed to have recognized more than a decade earlier when he had, under 
the guidance of inspiration, corrected this same passage in his Inspired Version 
of the Bible. This version was produced in the early 1830s and rendered the 
phrase “unto God, his Father.” In the present sermon, however, he declares the 
KJV rendering “altogether correct in the translation.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c12" 
name="rc12">[12]</A> Thus we find the teaching of Lorenzo Snow’s couplet being 
confirmed in final discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith.</P><A id="IV" name="IV"></A>
<P class="centerboldtopmargin">IV. The Ongoing Significance of the Couplet in 
Snow’s Career</P>
<P>Throughout his life Snow continued to stress the centrality of the teaching 
of the couplet. In a discourse published in 1894 he described it “as a star 
continually before me.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c13" 
name="rc13">[13]</A> There was never any question for Snow of it having arisen 
from the realm of speculation on his part. It came to him as a “vision, which 
was just as clear as the sun ever shone.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c14" 
name="rc14">[14]</A> In 1892 he included it in a poem, part of which reads as 
follows:</P>
<P class="quote-timesfont-noindent">This royal path has long been trod<BR>  By 
righteous men, each now a God:</P>
<P class="quote-timesfont-noindent">As Abra’m, Isaac, Jacob, too,<BR>  First 
babes, then men—to gods they grew.<BR>  As man now is, our God once was;<BR>  As 
now God is, so man may be,—<BR>Which doth unfold man’s destiny.<SPAN class="arialfont"><A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c15" 
name="rc15">[15]</A></SPAN></P>
<P>Nor did the couplet cease to represent a central element in Snow’s teaching 
after he was set apart as the fifth president of the LDS Church on September 13, 
1898. Indeed, he re-emphasized it in the strongest possible terms in a sermon 
preached only five days later, when, speaking on “the highest glory to which it 
is possible for man to attain,” Snow said:</P>
<P class="quote">That exalted position was made manifest to me at a very early 
day. I had a direct revelation of this. It was most perfect and complete. If 
there ever was a thing revealed to man perfectly, clearly, so that there could 
be no doubt or dubiety, this was revealed to me, and it came in these words: “As 
man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c16" 
name="rc16">[16]</A></P>
<P>About three months before his death, which occurred on 10 October 1901, Snow 
again affirmed the truth of the</P>
<P>couplet in the following words:</P>
<P class="quote">That fulfilled Father Smith’s declaration. Nothing was ever 
revealed more distinctly than that was to me. Of course, now that it is so well 
known it may not appear such a wonderful manifestation, but when I received it, 
the knowledge was marvelous to me.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c17" 
name="rc17">[17]</A></P><A id="V" name="V"></A>
<P class="centerboldtopmargin">V. The Couplet in Recent Times</P>
<P>Mouw’s assertion concerning the teaching of Lorenzo’s Snow’s couplet is 
remarkable given the fact that (for most of this writer’s lifetime, at least) it 
has fallen into the category of things Mormons know even if they know nothing 
else about their faith. The Osmond Brothers even included a song that alluded to 
this teaching called <EM>Before the Beginning</EM> on their 1973 album <EM>The 
Plan</EM>.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c18" 
name="rc18">[18]</A></P>
<P>If by “no functioning place” Mouw means that the couplet is no longer taught 
or mentioned in official and semi- official Mormon publications, then he is 
again incorrect. On that level all one needs to do is flip through the pages of 
the LDS Church’s official weekly newspaper, the <EM>LDS Church News</EM>, in 
order to find examples of the couplet being taught. The September 13, 1997 
issue, for example, included this quotation from Eldred G. Smith: “Temple 
Marriage is not just another form of church wedding; it is a divine covenant 
with the Lord that if we are faithful to the end, we may become as God now 
is.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c19" name="rc19">[19]</A> 
This passage not only quotes the couplet, it also clearly explains its 
continuing functioning place as a lynch-pin doctrine of the LDS Church relating 
to Temple Marriage. That LDS children continue to be taught the couplet can be 
seen in the nifty “President Lorenzo Snow Crossword,” included in the March 2002 
“Funstuf ” section of the LDS Church’s official Children’s magazine 
<EM>Friend</EM>, where we read as the clue for 10 across:</P>
<P class="quote">He wrote as a couplet (two lines of verse) a revelation that he 
had and that the Prophet Joseph Smith said was true: <EM>As 
man<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</U>is, God once was: As God now is, man may be</EM>.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c20" 
name="rc20">[20]</A></P>
<P class="notextindent">The correct answer filling in the blank is “now.” Notice 
in this case that the couplet is presented to Mormon children not merely as a 
“revelation” from God, but also as one that Joseph Smith himself had declared to 
be true. So again, how can Mouw be correct when he accuses Christians of bearing 
false witness when they say Mormons teach the couplet?</P>
<P>In defense of his remark Mouw appeals to a number of specific sources, 
including BYU professors Robert L. Millet and Stephen E. Robinson, as well as 
the 1997 book <A href="http://utlm.org/booklist/titles/mormonamericapaperback_xb178.htm"><EM>Mormon 
America</EM></A> by Richard N. and Joan K. Ostling. Mouw further states that “a 
number of LDS writers have been formulating the ‘becoming God’ theme in terms 
that are common in Eastern Orthodoxy.” We must now examine these sources.</P>
<P>1. <EM>Robert L. Millet</EM>. Robert L. Millet is a popular LDS writer and 
scholar toward whom many evangelicals in Utah and elsewhere look as the voice of 
a new Mormonism. This voice stands at the front of a concerted effort to drag 
the LDS Church, kicking and screaming if necessary, to a place much closer to 
traditional Christianity, though Millet himself firmly denies having any such 
intentions.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c21" 
name="rc21">[21]</A> Millet, it will be recalled, is one of the authors whose 
startling affirmation of the teaching of the couplet is at the head of this 
article.</P>
<P>Mouw credits Millet directly as a source for his claim that the teaching of 
the couplet is something current Mormon leaders “don’t understand” and that it 
“has no functioning place in present day Mormon doctrine.”<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c22" name="rc22">[22]</A> Following 
up on Mouw’s remarks I wrote to Millet asking him whether he really said the 
things Mouw credited him with saying. His answer was as follows:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">What I explained to Richard Mouw is that the related 
doctrines of “God was once a man,” and “Man may become as God,” though a part of 
our doctrinal literature and certainly accepted as truth by Latter-day Saints, 
are not a part of what might be called central, saving doctrine. President 
Hinckley, more than once, stated that he did not know much about the doctrine 
and didn’t know anyone that did. They are not discussed liberally at general 
conference, nor do we know much beyond the fact that Joseph Smith and Lorenzo 
Snow taught them.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c23" 
name="rc23">[23]</A></P>
<P>Millet does not go as far as Mouw, who asserts that Mormons do not teach the 
couplet. Millet says that Mormons regard the teaching of the couplet as true but 
not central. He does so on the basis of a general reference to public statements 
by current LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley.</P>
<P>2. <EM>Gordon B. Hinckley’s public expressions of agnosticism concerning 
Snow’s Couplet</EM>. The statements Millet alludes to both took place in 1997 
and have since become well known to critics of the LDS Church. Richard Ostling 
in his TIME Magazine, PBS <EM>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</EM> interview, asked 
President Hinckley whether “God the Father was once a man as we are.” Hinckley’s 
answer was: “I don’t know that we teach it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I haven’t heard it 
discussed for a long time in public discourse.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c24" 
name="rc24">[24]</A> Again in an interview with Don Lattin appearing in the 
<EM>San Francisco Chronicle</EM> in April 1997, Lattin asked Hinckley: “[D]on’t 
Mormons believe that God was once a man?” Hinckley replied: “I wouldn’t say 
that. There was a little couplet coined, ‘As man is, God once was. As God is, 
man may become.’ Now that’s more of a couplet than anything else. That gets into 
some pretty deep theology that we don’t know very much about.”<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c25" name="rc25">[25]</A></P>
<P>Richard and Joan Ostling noted how shortly after his public remarks, before 
an “in-house, all-Mormon audience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at General Conference, 
Hinckley talked about media depictions of the church and, in an apparently 
pointed reference to those interviews, assured his listeners, ‘None of you need 
worry because you read something that was incompletely reported. You need not 
worry that I do not understand some matters of doctrine.’ He added, ‘I think I 
understand them thoroughly.’&nbsp;”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c26" 
name="rc26">[26]</A></P>
<P>Millet seems to speak of these public statements as if they were official 
statements of current LDS thinking on the subject. There are three reasons we 
should not go along with him on this. First, when Luke Wilson, director of the 
Institute for Religious Research, questioned the First Presidency<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c27" name="rc27">[27]</A> about the 
accuracy of the quotation of Hinckley in TIME Magazine, F. Michael Watson, 
Secretary to the First Presidency, responded: “The quotation you reference was 
taken out of context.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c28" 
name="rc28">[28]</A> By the First Presidency’s own account, therefore, 
Hinckley’s public remarks in the TIME Magazine, PBS <EM>NewsHour with Jim 
Lehrer</EM> interview, at least, should not be taken as representative of 
Hinckley’s true position, much less the official teaching of the LDS Church on 
the matter.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c29" 
name="rc29">[29]</A></P>
<P>Second, there is evidence that Hinckley, who is regularly referred to as the 
PR Prophet, was being intentionally vague before non-Mormon audiences, perhaps 
hoping to make Mormonism appear more mainstream Christian. Thus in an interview 
on Australian television with David Ransom that was aired on 9 November 1997, 
Hinckley similarly hedged on another foundational Mormon teaching, only to back 
down when challenged:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent"><EM>RB</EM>: And God has a wife?<BR><EM>GBH</EM>: I 
don’t know, but I suppose so. As we have a Father I assume we have a 
mother.<BR><EM>RB</EM>: I understood your teachings said that God has a 
wife?<BR><EM>GBH</EM>: Yes. Well we .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes we have a mother in 
heaven. We believe so. We’re sons and daughters of God.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c30" 
name="rc30">[30]</A></P>
<P>The doctrine that God has a wife is very frequently and openly taught in 
official LDS Church publications. It is declared in the widely publicized “The 
Family: A Proclamation to the World,” issued by the First Presidency and the 
Council of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church in September 1995, that:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">ALL HUMAN BEINGS—male and female—are created in the 
image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, 
as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential 
characteristic of individual pre-mortal, mortal, and eternal identity and 
purpose.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c31" 
name="rc31">[31]</A></P>
<P class="notextindent">We see this teaching fleshed out in the model dialogue 
between a father and his ten-year-old son Dean, in the <EM>Parent’s Guide</EM> 
published and currently used by the LDS Church:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">“Who made our bodies first of all?”</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">“Heavenly Father” was the prompt answer.</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">“That’s right, son. Heavenly Father made Adam and Eve. 
&nbsp;Who do they look like?”</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">“Heavenly Father and Jesus, and I guess our heavenly 
mother too,” said the now attentive boy.</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">“Well, we really don’t know much about our heavenly 
mother, but we can expect that Eve looked like her and Adam looked like Heavenly 
Father.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c32" 
name="rc32">[32]</A></P>
<P>Hymn number 292 in the current LDS hymnal, <EM>O My Father</EM>, emphasizes 
this doctrine in the words: “When I lay this mortal body by, Father, Mother may 
I meet you in your royal courts on high?” In the context the author, Eliza R. 
Snow, was not speaking of her earthly parents, but of the heavenly Father and 
Mother. This same hymn is included in the selection of hymns in the standard LDS 
Church published introductory book on Mormonism, <EM>Gospel Principles</EM>.<A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c33" 
name="rc33">[33]</A> Gordon B. Hinckley knows it and refers to it in a 
discussion on whether the practice of some Mormons of praying to the Mother in 
heaven is acceptable: “It has been said that the Prophet Joseph Smith made no 
correction to what Sister Snow had written. Therefore, we have a Mother in 
heaven.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c34" 
name="rc34">[34]</A> So when Hinckley began his answer to the question about the 
wife of God with, “I don’t know, but I assume .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” he was 
interjecting a note of doubt that we do not find when he speaks of the doctrine 
before believing Mormons.</P>
<P>Third, we should not look to the context of interviews with outsiders to find 
Hinckley’s most authoritative explanations of Mormon doctrine. Such settings are 
not always entirely friendly, so we should not be surprised to find Hinckley 
somewhat more guarded than when he is before more accepting audiences.</P>
<P>Hinckley himself has remarked that interviews with the public media are 
“always a worrisome undertaking because one never knows what will be asked.”<A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c35" 
name="rc35">[35]</A> They seem, he goes on to say, to “know how to ask questions 
that come at you like a javelin. It is not exactly an enjoyable experience.”</P>
<P>Does Hinckley know very much about the teaching of the couplet? The best 
answer seems to be the one he gave the faithful at the October 1997 general 
conference: he understands it “thoroughly.” But for some reason he wanted to 
play down its significance before non-Mormon audiences. Consistent with such a 
conclusion is the fact that Hinckley is familiar with the King Follett Discourse 
and refers to it as “an important doctrinal document in the theology of the 
Church.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c36" 
name="rc36">[36]</A> In addition, the <EM>Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley</EM>, 
published in the same year as the public statements we have been discussing, 
contains explicit teaching on the couplet:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">The whole design of the gospel is to lead us, onward 
and upward to greater achievement, even, eventually, to godhood. This great 
possibility was enunciated by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the King Follett 
sermon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and emphasized by President Lorenzo Snow. It is this 
grand and incomparable concept: <EM>As God now is, man may become!</EM><A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c37" name="rc37">[37]</A></P>
<P class="notextindent">It should be noted, however, that even though Hinckley 
is discussing Snow’s couplet, he is not focusing on the first part, the part 
about God having once been a man. This is consistent with what Hinckley said in 
the <EM>San Francisco Chronicle</EM> interview. After Hinckley had said that the 
couplet contained “some pretty deep theology that we don’t know very much 
about,” Don Lattin came back with: “So you’re saying the church is still 
struggling to understand this?” Hinckley replied: “Well, as God is, man may 
become. We believe in eternal progression. Very strongly. We believe that the 
glory of God is intelligence and whatever principle of intelligence we attain 
unto in this life, it will rise with us in the Resurrection. Knowledge, 
learning, is an eternal thing.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c38" 
name="rc38">[38]</A></P>
<P>This raises an interesting question: Is it possible that Hinckley and the 
present LDS Church are trying to play down the first half of Snow’s couplet 
while continuing to emphasize the second? Is there a trend toward avoiding 
discussion of God’s history as a man, while at the same time continuing to 
affirm our future as Gods? If such a trend is underway, it should not be hard to 
detect, because the content of official church publications is strictly 
monitored by the so-called Correlation Committee, which oversees the content of 
LDS Church publications.</P>
<P>And, indeed, as we look at materials published by the LDS Church itself, as 
opposed to less official Mormon publishers, which regularly publish much less 
guarded statements,<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c39" 
name="rc39">[39]</A> we discover that this does appear to be a trend.</P>
<P>3. <EM>Our becoming Gods</EM>. There are regular and repeated references to 
our becoming Gods, even retaining the capital “G,” but increasingly few explicit 
statements about how God moved from being as we are now to his current exalted 
state. So, for example, in the 2001 John Taylor volume of the <EM>Teachings of 
the Presidents of The Church</EM> series, used in the regular weekly meetings at 
the Ward,<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c40" 
name="rc40">[40]</A> each human is called “a God in embryo” [capital “G”] who 
possesses “in an embryonic state, all the faculties and powers of a God. And 
when he shall be perfected, and have progressed to maturity, he will be like his 
Father—a God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As the horse, the ox, the sheep, and every living 
creature, including man, propagates its own species and perpetuates its own 
kind, so does God perpetuate his.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c41" 
name="rc41">[41]</A></P>
<P>The February 2002 issue of the LDS Church magazine <EM>Ensign</EM> reprinted 
a 1909 First Presidency statement declaring that “the undeveloped offspring of 
celestial parentage [i.e. the human being] is capable, by experience through 
ages and aeons, of evolving into a God [capital ‘G’].”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c42" 
name="rc42">[42]</A> And lest there be any doubt about the continuing authority 
of this First Presidency statement, we find in the “Making the Most of This 
Issue” section at the end of the same issue a teaser for it that asks: “Ever 
wonder about the Church’s official teaching on the creation of mankind and 
evolution?”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c43" 
name="rc43">[43]</A></P>
<P>The present edition of the widely used introductory manual <EM>Gospel 
Principles</EM> declares of those who “receive exaltation in the celestial 
kingdom” that “[t]hey will become gods” and “will have everything that our 
Heavenly Father and Jesus have—all power, glory, dominion, and knowledge.”<A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c44" 
name="rc44">[44]</A></P>
<P>4. <EM>God’s history as a man who worshipped a more ancient deity</EM>. Early 
editions of <EM>Gospel Principles</EM> (1978–88) said that “[o]ur spirits 
resemble our heavenly parents although they have resurrected bodies. We have 
inherited the potential to develop their divine qualities. If we choose to do 
so, we can become perfect as they are.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c45" 
name="rc45">[45]</A> Beginning with the 1992 edition, however, the phrase 
“although they have resurrected bodies” was dropped.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c46" 
name="rc46">[46]</A></P>
<P>Among the few explicit discussions of the history of God in recent times in 
official church publications were (1) the 1985 <EM>Search These Commandments: 
Melchizedek Priesthood Personal Study Guide</EM>; and (2) the LDS Institute 
(college-level) manual <EM>Achieving a Celestial Marriage</EM> (1992). In the 
former, we read under the heading “Our Father Advanced and Progressed Until He 
Became God”:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>President Joseph Fielding Smith said: “<EM>Our Father in heaven, according 
  to the Prophet, had a Father</EM>, and since there has been a condition of 
  this kind through all eternity, each Father had a Father” (<EM>Doctrines of 
  Salvation</EM> 2:42).</LI>
  <LI>President Joseph F. Smith taught: “I know that God is a being with body, 
  parts and passions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Man was born of woman; Christ, the 
  Savior, was born of woman; and God, the Father was born of woman” (<EM>Church 
  News</EM> [Sept. 19, 1936] 2).<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c47" 
  name="rc47">[47]</A></LI></UL>
<P>And the first paragraph of the introduction of the latter:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">In the relationships of husband and wife and parent 
and child we begin to approach the divine calling of godhood. Our Heavenly 
Father and mother live in an exalted state because they achieved a celestial 
marriage. As we achieve a like marriage we shall become as they are and begin 
the creation of worlds for our own spirit children.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c48" 
name="rc48">[48]</A></P>
<P>For a long time the writer expected <EM>Achieving a Celestial Marriage</EM>, 
which continued to be used as an institute text for some years after Hinckley’s 
1997 interviews, would be revised or replaced, because it stood nearly alone 
among LDS Church published materials in the blatant link it makes between our 
heavenly parents’ exaltation and our own. This finally happened in 2001 when it 
was replaced by a new manual that avoids such explicit descriptions of the 
mechanism underlying the first half of Snow’s couplet.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c49" 
name="rc49">[49]</A></P>
<P>All of this is not to say, however, that the teaching of the first half of 
Snow’s couplet has been abandoned or rejected. One needs only to read the 
reaffirmation of it in the new institute manual <EM>Presidents of the 
Church</EM> (2003) to know that the LDS Church still embraces both halves.<A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c50" 
name="rc50">[50]</A> It would further seem an overstatement to say that the LDS 
Church is de-emphasizing the teaching of the first half of the couplet. What 
really appears to be happening is that the language used to express the teaching 
is being intentionally toned down: same teaching, different words used to 
describe it.</P>
<P>5. <EM>Stephen E. Robinson, Mouw, and the “official” question</EM>. Mouw also 
had said that “Stephen Robinson insisted, in the book he co-authored with Craig 
Blomberg, that this [i.e. the teaching of the couplet] is not an official Mormon 
teaching.” Robinson’s actual words in relation to Snow’s Couplet and the King 
Follett Discourse are as follows:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">Neither statement is scriptural or canonized in the 
technical sense, and neither has been explained or elucidated to the church in 
any official manner, but they are so widely accepted by Latter-day Saints that 
this technical point has become moot.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c51" 
name="rc51">[51]</A></P>
<P>Robinson actually admits that the teaching of the couplet is “so widely 
accepted by Latter-day Saints” that the technical question of its canonicity 
“has become moot.” This is not the point one would have naturally gathered from 
Mouw’s depiction of what Robinson had said.</P>
<P>Robinson’s statement that it has not been “explained or elucidated to the 
church in any official manner,” however, is simply false. The reality is that 
throughout the history of the LDS Church it has been almost continually 
“explained or elucidated” in every possible official manner, short of giving it 
its own page in LDS Scripture. In the February 1982 <EM>Ensign</EM>, the issue 
was raised in the “I Have a Question” column whether Snow’s couplet was 
“accepted as official doctrine of the church.” Gerald N. Lund responded by 
saying that “there has been no ‘official’ pronouncement by the First Presidency 
declaring that President Snow’s couplet is to be accepted as doctrine”—“[b]ut 
that is not a valid criteria for determining whether or not it <EM>is</EM> 
doctrine.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c52" 
name="rc52">[52]</A> The bottom line is that “it is clear that the teaching of 
President Snow is both acceptable and accepted doctrine in the Church today.”<A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c53" 
name="rc53">[53]</A> Lund also quotes Joseph Fielding Smith’s 1971 remark that 
Snow’s couplet expressed a doctrine that “has of course been known to the 
prophets of all the ages.”</P>
<P>Here as well is an appropriate point for bringing up Mouw’s comment that the 
couplet is not “an official Mormon teaching.” The problem is that the LDS Church 
has never clearly defined a process by which its doctrines become “official.” 
For the rank-and-file Mormon the teaching set forth by the prophetic leadership 
at the semi-annual general conference is as official as it gets. In a way, 
everything the LDS Church teaches <EM>now</EM> is official <EM>now</EM>, but 
that may all change later, as it has in the past. Therefore everything the 
Church teaches is also at least potentially unofficial. The main thing the 
individual Mormon must do is to find out what is being taught now and believe it 
as God’s word for them. To the evangelical this process seems both dubious and 
strange, but the Mormon finds it easy to explain under the umbrella of 
progressive revelation. In the meantime, Mormon scholars quite appropriately 
speculate about how teachings become “official.” But at this stage their 
speculations cannot in any way be said to be official, and therefore it is quite 
inappropriate for them to try to insist that non-Mormon scholars must prove 
well-known Mormon doctrines to be official before they are allowed to speak of 
them. Rather, non-Mormon scholars must evaluate the various theories of 
“official” in order to see which, if any, correspond to the actual way in which 
authority functions in the Mormon Church. Unfortunately, Robinson himself has 
set forth a very inadequate theory. According to him, there are three things 
that make a Mormon teaching official: (1) it is taught in the “standard works, 
the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine &amp; Covenants, and the Pearl of Great 
Price”;<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c54" name="rc54">[54]</A> 
(2) it appears in an “official statements of the First Presidency and/or the 
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles”;<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c55" 
name="rc55">[55]</A> and (3) it is “sustained” by being voted on in general 
conference.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c56" 
name="rc56">[56]</A></P>
<P>Of the three criteria, only the second carries any real weight. Functionally, 
the reality approaches a situation in which the voice of the present leadership 
trumps all three. The LDS canon does not function for Mormons in the same way 
that the biblical canon functions for Christians. One of the reasons for this is 
that Joseph Smith’s theology changed rapidly and radically during the course of 
his career. As a result, the Book of Mormon contains teachings that are 
radically at odds with both current Mormon doctrine and the doctrine of the 
other books in the Mormon canon. For example, Book of Mormon Christology falls 
to the right of traditional trinitarianism in that it does not distinguish 
clearly between the divine persons, yet the Book of Abraham in the Pearl of 
Great Price falls to the left of traditional trinitarianism in that it abandons 
the unity of the Godhead in favor of a doctrine of plurality of Gods.<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c57" name="rc57">[57]</A> Because of 
this tension current Mormonism can only derive things from the Book of Mormon 
where it agrees with current LDS teaching. Where it does not agree, it must be 
artificially harmonized, as when new meanings are given to theological words 
Joseph Smith used in the Book of Mormon where he originally meant something 
quite different from current LDS understanding. For example, because the Book of 
Mormon speaks of God as “omnipotent” (Mosiah 3:5) and “knowing all things” (2 
Nephi 9:20), Mormons are forced to own these words. Yet in doing so they must 
also radically redefine them, so that God’s omnipotence and omniscience do not 
interfere with the same attributes in all the Gods that went before (e.g. God 
the Father’s father) and that will come after (e.g. all the Gods in embryo that 
now dwell upon the earth).</P>
<P>So, for example, since the meaning of traditional theological terms has been 
redefined in Mormonism, Robert L. Millet and Joseph Fielding McConkie can write 
things such as the following, which are absurd from a historic Christian 
perspective:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">Our Father’s development and progression over an 
infinitely long period of time has brought him to a point at which he now 
presides as God Almighty, He is omnipotent, omniscient, and, by means of his 
Holy Spirit, omnipresent: he has all power, all knowledge, and is, through the 
Light of Christ, in and through all things.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c58" 
name="rc58">[58]</A></P>
<P class="notextindent">Does Mouw think that the LDS Church has adopted the 
traditional meanings of the uses of the “omnis” or other traditional terms in 
relation to God? If so, he is mistaken.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c59" 
name="rc59">[59]</A></P>
<P>Robinson’s third criterion that a teaching has been “sustained” or voted upon 
in general conference also fails to describe accurately how teachings become 
official in the LDS Church. In the first place, votes taken at general 
conference sessions are invariably unanimous. Since <EM>Ensign</EM> began 
tracking this in the early 1970s there has never been a report of a 
non-unanimous vote at general conference. It is true that the reports for the 
October 1975 general conference and the general conferences from 1981 to 1983 do 
not mention whether the vote was unanimous and that therefore it may be that 
some “troublemaker” had voted against the crowd; all the others (October 1974 
and April 1975 and every conference between April 1976 and October 1980 and 
between April 1984 and the present) have been unanimous.</P>
<P>Robinson’s presentation makes things sound more democratic than they really 
are. As Clark L. and Kathryn H. Kidd write,</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">Voting against sustaining is such a rare occurrence 
that many Church members never see it happen. The reason for this is that most 
members realize that they are not casting a vote when they raise their hands 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they are being asked to ratify or sustain a decision that has 
been made by those in authority.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c60" 
name="rc60">[60]</A></P>
<P>Since the results of the sustaining vote are always the same, they are a mere 
formality, a rubber stamp. Because this is the case, there is really no reason 
for the leadership to delay action until general conference once they have set 
their minds on doing something. A case in point is President Spencer W. 
Kimball’s revelation granting the priesthood to blacks announced on June 9, 
1978, which marked one of the greatest turning points in LDS history. Robinson 
cites it as an example of how doctrine becomes official:</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">When Spencer W. Kimball declared in 1978, by 
revelation from the Lord, that the priesthood was henceforward to be given to 
all worthy male members, this pronouncement became Official Declaration—2 by the 
sustaining vote of a general conference on 30 September 1978.<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c61" name="rc61">[61]</A></P>
<P class="notextindent">Robinson only gives part of the story. The LDS Church 
leadership did not wait until it had been sustained in general conference to put 
the new revelation into practice. Rather, it began immediately. Probably the 
first African American to be ordained to the LDS priesthood in the United States 
was Joseph Freeman Jr. of Granger, Utah, only two days after the June 9 
announcement.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c62" 
name="rc62">[62]</A> By the time the next general conference was convened the 
floodgates had already long since been opened and the ordination of blacks 
become an irreversible reality. The only thing that remained was for the 
gathered faithful to cast their obligatory unanimous vote in favor of its 
inclusion in the <EM>Doctrine &amp; Covenants</EM>, which they did at the 
Saturday afternoon session on September 30, 1978.</P><A id="VI" name="VI"></A>
<P class="centerboldtopmargin">VI. The Couplet and the Doctrine of 
Deification</P>
<P>Mouw comments that “[a] number of LDS writers have been formulating the 
‘becoming God’ theme in terms that are common in Eastern Orthodoxy: that ‘we 
shall be like Him’ in the sense of I John, but that we will never <EM>be</EM> 
Him.” As far as I know, no Mormon ever taught that we are going to be God the 
Father. A better way of expressing this from the perspective of the Mormon 
system is to say that we will never <EM>catch up</EM> with God. We may well 
reach a point at which we will be equal in attributes and exaltation to God as 
he is now. But by the time we do, God will have become more exalted. Indeed, the 
very fact that we as his children come to be exalted actually adds to his 
greater exaltation, and by extension, to the greater exaltation of the current 
God’s God, and indeed of all the Gods above him. Exaltation, in other words, 
functions as a sort of cosmic pyramid scheme. This is the teaching of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith in the King Follett Discourse: “God is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
glorified and exalted in the salvation and exaltation of all his children.”<A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c63" 
name="rc63">[63]</A></P>
<P>What Mouw is referring to also has to do with the current interest among 
Mormon apologists in the Eastern Orthodox doctrine of deification. Although we 
find occasional earlier references to the alleged similarity between the Mormon 
and Orthodox teaching on deification,<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c64" 
name="rc64">[64]</A> the current interest among Mormons in this doctrine arose 
in the 1970s and 1980s after two Mormon scholars, Philip L. Barlow and Keith E. 
Norman, became interested in the subject independently while studying at 
Harvard.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c65" 
name="rc65">[65]</A></P>
<P>But it is Stephen E. Robinson who has done most to give the apparent 
similarity an apologetic slant. In his <EM>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</EM> 
subentry “LDS Doctrine Compared With Other Christian Doctrines,”<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c66" name="rc66">[66]</A> Robinson 
quotes what he says is the second-century writer Irenaeus of Lyons as saying, 
“If the word became a man, it was so men may become gods.” In reality, it is not 
Irenaeus he is quoting (Irenaeus never said this)<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c67" 
name="rc67">[67]</A> but the generalized couplet used by Eastern Orthodox 
theologians, beginning with Athanasius, to express the doctrine. In the context 
Robinson claims that the Eastern Orthodox couplet says “essentially the same 
thing” as Lorenzo Snow’s couplet.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c68" 
name="rc68">[68]</A></P>
<P>More recently, even Mormon Apostle Dallin Oaks spoke of the alleged similarly 
between Eastern Orthodox and LDS teaching at general conference when he said 
that the Mormon understanding of the future life “should be familiar to all who 
have studied the ancient Christian doctrine of deification or apotheosis.”<A 
class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c69" 
name="rc69">[69]</A></P>
<P>This development would seem to function very nicely in the LDS/Evangelical 
apologetic exchange, because by appealing to the ancient doctrine LDS writers 
can present themselves as closer to the roots of Christianity than Western 
Christians, who use the language of deification only infrequently.<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c70" name="rc70">[70]</A> But the 
emphasis must rest on the words “<EM>seem</EM> to function.”</P>
<P>In reality, there is nothing in the Eastern Orthodox or early Christian 
doctrine of deification to which any Western Christian should object. Indeed, 
there is much to be gained by reading the mature Eastern Orthodox reflection on 
the subject.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c71" 
name="rc71">[71]</A> The only problem from an exegetical point of view is that 
the standard formulation of the doctrine relies on a misinterpretation of a 
particular passage in the Gospel of John. Early Christians did not have trouble 
describing their future hope in terms of “becoming gods,” because they took 
Jesus’ quote of Ps 82:6, “I said you are gods,” in John 10:34 to be a reference 
to “those .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who have received the grace of the ‘adoption,’ by 
which we cry, ‘Abba Father’&nbsp;” (Irenaeus, <EM>Against Heresies</EM> 3.6.1; 
cf. Justin Martyr, <EM>Dialogue with Trypho</EM> 124).<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c72" 
name="rc72">[72]</A> But there is no reason to suppose that that is what the 
author of John had in mind.</P>
<P>The real appeal of the Eastern Orthodox doctrine to Mormon apologists is that 
it is regularly stated in a way that <EM>sounds</EM> similar to Snow’s couplet. 
But this has to do more with the fact that a couplet is used in both cases than 
that the two couplets have anything really in common. It is in fact when one 
lays the two couplets side by side to reflect upon Robinson’s claim that they 
say “essentially the same thing” that their real differences appear.</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">First Half:<BR>  Snow’s Couplet: “As man now is God 
once was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<BR>Athanasius’s Couplet: “the Word of God 
Himself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. assumed humanity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ”<BR>(<EM>On the 
Incarnation of the Divine Word</EM> 54)<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c73" 
name="rc73">[73]</A></P>
<P>Here Snow is talking about the Father’s having become God, even though he was 
previously a man. Athanasius was talking about the Son’s having become a man, 
even though he was previously God.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c74" 
name="rc74">[74]</A> Who can fail to see that, although similar words are used, 
the underlying concepts are completely different?</P>
<P class="quote-noindent">Second Half:<BR>  Snow’s Couplet: “As God now is man 
may be.”<BR>Athanasius’s Couplet: “ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that we might become 
God.”</P>
<P>The Orthodox teaching refers to our <EM>becoming</EM>, as 2 Pet 1:4 says, 
“partakers of the divine nature,” through union with Jesus Christ. John’s Gospel 
presents Jesus as praying that believers will be one as he and the Father are 
one (John 17:21; cf. 10:30), yet it is without in any way losing sight of Jesus’ 
unique relationship with God as both the pre-existent Word and only begotten of 
the Father (John 1:1, 18). The Son has divine life in himself (John 5:26). We 
have it only through the Son (John 3:36; 6:53–54, 68; 10:28), only as we abide 
in him (John 15:1–7). The same point is made by Athanasius: we partake of 
Christ’s divine life only because Jesus first partook of our mortal flesh:</P>
<P class="quote">But if death was within the body, woven into its very substance 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the need was for Life to be woven into it instead 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Saviour assumed a body for Himself, in order that the body 
[i.e. our bodies], being interwoven as it were with life, should no longer 
remain a mortal thing, in thrall to death, but as endued with immortality and 
risen from death, should therefore remain immortal. For once having put on 
corruption, it could not rise, unless it put on life instead.” (<EM>On the 
Incarnation of the Divine Word</EM> 44)</P>
<P>Mormons, however, cannot really appeal to 2 Pet 1:4 in defense of their 
doctrine at all, because their notion of exaltation does not involve becoming 
partakers of the divine nature.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c75" 
name="rc75">[75]</A> They believe that they have the divine nature already, as 
“literally the sons and daughters of Deity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. undeveloped offspring 
of celestial parentage,”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c76" 
name="rc76">[76]</A> “gods in embryo,”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c77" 
name="rc77">[77]</A> and, to use Robinson’s own words, as the “same species of 
being as God.”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c78" 
name="rc78">[78]</A> They only have to grow up into it through a process toward 
perfection that includes a period of testing during the mortal experience.</P><A

<P class="centerboldtopmargin">VII. Conclusion: Mouw, the Couplet, and the 
Future</P>
<P>Richard Mouw has served very faithfully as a kind of evangelical statesman, 
and I believe he has much to contribute to the evangelical/Mormon dialogue in 
the future. In relation to the continuing currency of Lorenzo Snow’s Couplet, 
however, Mouw is simply incorrect when he says that it has “no functioning place 
in present-day Mormon doctrine.” Mouw’s recent apology also places him in a 
somewhat ambiguous position given the fact that he contributed an enthusiastic 
preface to a book published in 2002 containing two articles presenting Snow’s 
couplet as representative of Mormon teaching.<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c79" 
name="rc79">[79]</A> In that preface, Mouw offered an apology similar to the one 
rendered in the Mormon Tabernacle. He stressed how “ashamed” he was “of our 
record in relating to the Mormon community”<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c80" 
name="rc80">[80]</A> and spoke of how “we evangelicals” had been “bearing false 
witness against our LDS neighbors.” Against this he set the essays contained in 
the book, which he represented as “a laudable attempt to set the record 
straight.” The question raised by Mouw’s more recent apology in the Tabernacle 
is whether he has changed his mind in the past two years and come to believe 
that the book he previously praised is guilty of bearing false witness as well, 
and that he now wishes to distance himself from it.</P>
<P>However that may be, it has been the writer’s purpose in the present article 
to show that Snow’s couplet is not irrelevant to current Mormon teaching. Unlike 
relics of old Mormonism such as Brigham Young’s Adam-God doctrine<A class="super-3" 
href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c81" name="rc81">[81]</A> or plural 
marriage,<A class="super-3" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#c82" 
name="rc82">[82]</A> Lorenzo Snow’s couplet summarizes a truth that still lives 
at the heart and logical center of the whole Mormon religious system. 
Evangelicals are not therefore “bearing false witness” when they regard it as 
representative of Mormon belief and critically discuss it as such.</P>

Some editions of the sermon punctuate in such a way as to avoid Joseph’s having 
meant that God the Father had a Father by placing a comma after <EM>above</EM> 
so that it has Joseph saying instead: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there being a God 
above[,] the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (e.g. JS-H 6:474). There is no 
indication in the original manuscript of the sermon suggesting the inclusion of 
a comma (see <EM>The Words of Joseph Smith</EM> [2d rev. ed./1st computer ed.; 
comp. and ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook; Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret, 
1996] 379 [GospeLink CD-Rom]), nor is the sense it gives borne out in the rest 
of the sermon. Quite the contrary, the idea that God the Father had a father is 
explicitly endorsed at other places in the sermon:</P>
<P class="endnotequote">If Jesus Christ was the Son of God, and John discovered 
that God, the Father of Jesus Christ, had a Father, you may suppose that 
<EM>he</EM> had a Father also. Where was there ever a son without a father? And 
where was there ever a father without first being a son? Whenever did a tree or 
anything spring into existence without a progenitor? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hence if 
Jesus had a Father, can we not also believe that <EM>he</EM> had a Father also?

In this we distinguish between materials actually published by the LDS Church 
and those published by popular Mormon publishers like Bookcraft, Covenant, or 
Deseret Book Company. In these publications much of what has always been said 
about traditional Mormon teaching continues unabated. See, for example, chapters 
5 (“<A href="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=45&amp;chapid=534" 
target="_blank">Do Latter-day Saints Believe that Men and Women Can Become 
Gods?</A>”) and 6 (“<A href="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=45&amp;chapid=535" 
target="_blank">What do Latter-day Saints Mean When They Say that God was Once a 
Man?</A>”) in <A href="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=45&amp;chapid=" 
target="_blank"><EM>Latter-day Saints: 10 Basic Issues</EM></A> (ed. Robert L. 
Millet and Noel B. Reynolds; Provo, UT: Foundations for Ancient Research and 
Mormon Studies, 1998) 25–29, 31–33. See also Robert J. Matthews, “The Doctrine 
of the Atonement: The Revelation of the Gospel to Adam,” in <EM>Studies in 
Scripture, Volume 2: The Pearl of Great Price</EM> (ed. Robert L. Millet and 
Kent P. Jackson; Salt Lake City, UT: Deseret, 1998) 114–15 (GospeLink

<P class="endnotequote">The plan of salvation is older than the earth and has 
not been added to or changed since that early time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Elder Orson 
Pratt expressed his understanding of the antiquity and unchangeableness of the 
plan as follows:</P>
<P class="endnotequotedouble">The dealing of God toward his children 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a pattern after which all other worlds are dealt with. The 
creation, fall and redemption of all future worlds with their inhabitants, will 
be upon the same general plan. The Father of our spirits has only been doing 
what his progenitors did before him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The same plan of 
redemption is carried out by which more ancient worlds have been redeemed. The 
reason Elder Pratt’s statement makes doctrinal sense is because the plan of God 
is perfect, and perfection is unchanging. If the plan of redemption varied from 
time to time, from world to world, or person to person, men would be saved by 
different means, and salvation would have its bargain days. The “sameness” of 
the plan of salvation does not mean that every world is an exact monotonous and 
unimaginative copy of every other, or that there are the same number of 
inhabitants on each. It means that the same eternal principles, the same kind of 
mortality and the same kind of salvation are in effect wherever there are gods 
and devils and men.</P>

Such a mistake is certainly understandable in view of the way Robinson writes on 
these things, as for example when he says: “Latter-day Saints do not, or at 
least should not, believe that they will ever be independent in all eternity 
from their Father in heaven or from their Savior Jesus Christ or from the Holy 
Spirit. Those who are exalted by his grace will always be ‘gods’ (always with a 
small <EM>g</EM>, even in the Doctrine and Covenants) by grace, by an extension 
of <EM>his</EM> power, and will always be subordinate to the Godhead” (Blomberg 
and Robinson, <EM>How Wide</EM> 86). This statement of Robinson’s is of course 
not official, nor is it consistent with the Church manuals he reads and 
discusses at his local Mormon ward, which, as we have already seen, freely use 
the capital “G” in describing what we shall be, as do First Presidency 
statements (<A href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/02/the-origin-of-man?lang=eng" 
target="_blank"><EM>Ensign</EM> [Feb. 2002] 30</A>). Nevertheless, Robinson’s 
view need not contradict what might be called the continuous teaching of the 
Mormon Church, as long as he is willing to say that the present God the Father 
is also eternally dependent on his Father, Savior, and Holy Spirit, and 
therefore is also ultimately only a god with a small “g” just like we will be). 
However, much as the LDS Church has become reserved in teaching the traditional 
Mormon plan of salvation as expressed in the couplet, it has never repudiated 
it. Therefore Robinson must be asked whether he wants to say that the current 
God is more ultimate in some sense than the Gods that went before. And then, if 
the answer is yes, why?</P>

We still occasionally encounter it, as, for example, in the eighth-century 
Celtic theologian John Scotus Eriugena (d.&nbsp;c. 877) who declares: “He 
[Jesus] came down alone but ascends with many. He who made of God a human being 
makes gods of men and women” (<EM>Prologue to the Gospel of John</EM> 21; ET: 
<EM>Celtic Spirituality</EM> [The Classics of Western Spirituality; trans. and 
intro. Oliver Davies with the collaboration of Thomas O’Loughlin; New 
York/Mahwah, NJ: Paulist, 1999] 430). The great western Father Augustine of 
Hippo (d. 430) also uses the language of deification: “For God wishes to make 
thee a god; not by nature, as He is whom He has begotten, but by his gift and 
adoption” (<EM>Sermon</EM> 166:4; quoted in Norman, <A href="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/papers/?paperID=5" 
target="_blank"><EM>Deification: The Content of Athanasian Soteriology</EM></A> 
104). Deification language has even been preserved as part of the Roman Catholic 
Mass, where it currently appears as part of the Liturgy of the Eucharist: “By 
the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of 
Christ, who humbled himself to share in our humanity.” On the evangelical side 
we find it, for example, in the lyrics of the great Methodist hymnologist 
Charles Wesley (d. 1788): “He deigns in flesh to appear, Widest extremes to 
join; To bring our vileness near, And make us all divine” (hymn <EM>Let Heaven 
and Earth Combine</EM>). Or again, speaking more broadly of trinitarians as 
such, Ralph Waldo Emerson writes in his journal entry for Feb. 14, 1827: “The 
Trinitarian urges a natural &amp; sublime deduction from his creed when he says 
of the Saviour that as he became a partaker in our humanity so we also shall 
become partakers in his divinity” (<EM>Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of 
Ralph Waldo Emerson</EM> [ed. William H. Gilman and Alfred R. Ferguson; 
Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University, 1963] 3.74).</P>

Craig L. Blomberg has already underscored this important distinction: “Most of

<P class="subheading-5">Current Status of the Lorenzo Snow Couplet</P>
<P class="center"><STRONG>By Sandra Tanner</STRONG></P>
<P>During the seven years since the original publication of the previous article 
by Ron Huggins, Dr. Richard J. Mouw has continued to maintain that the Lorenzo 
Snow couplet is no longer promoted as LDS theology and refers to it as “folk 
Mormonism.”<A class="super-2" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#d1" 
name="rd1">[1]</A> However, the official LDS priesthood manuals published in 
2011 and 2012 have quoted it.</P>
<P>In 2011 the LDS Church issued the manual <EM>Teachings of Presidents of the 
Church: George Albert Smith</EM>. In it we read:</P>
<P class="quote">Eternal life is to us the sum of pre-existence, present 
existence, and the continuation of life in immortality, holding out to us the 
power of endless progression and increase. With that feeling and that assurance, 
we believe that <STRONG>“As man is, God once was, and as God is, man may 
become.”</STRONG> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we believe that it is not improper, that it is 
not unrighteous, for us to hope that we may be permitted to partake of the 
attributes of deity and, if we are faithful, <STRONG>to become like unto 
God</STRONG>; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P>This year the study manual for both the LDS Priesthood and Relief Society is 
<A href="https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-lorenzo-snow?lang=eng" 
target="_blank"><EM>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Lorenzo 
Snow</EM></A>. In chapter 5, “The Grand Destiny of the Faithful,” we read about 
Snow’s formulating of the couplet:</P>
<P class="quote">In the spring of 1840, Lorenzo Snow was in Nauvoo, Illinois, 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. President Snow later recalled, “the Spirit of the Lord rested 
mightily upon me—the eyes of my understanding were opened, and I saw as clear as 
the sun at noonday, with wonder and astonishment, the pathway of God and man. I 
formed the following couplet which expresses <STRONG>the revelation</STRONG>, as 
it was shown me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class="quotedouble-noindent"><STRONG><EM>“As man now is, God once 
was:</EM></STRONG><BR><STRONG><EM>“As God now is, man may be.”</EM></STRONG></P>
<P class="quote">Feeling that he had received “a sacred communication” that he 
should guard carefully, Lorenzo Snow did not teach the <STRONG>doctrine</STRONG> 
publicly <STRONG>until he knew that the Prophet Joseph Smith had taught 
it.</STRONG> Once he knew the <STRONG>doctrine</STRONG> was public knowledge, he 
testified of it frequently.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His son LeRoi, said, “This 
<STRONG>revealed truth</STRONG> impressed Lorenzo Snow more than perhaps all 
else .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<A class="super-2" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#d2" 
name="rd2">[2]</A></P>
<P>Further on the manual quotes Lorenzo Snow regarding God’s progression:</P>
<P class="quote">Through <STRONG>a continual course of progression</STRONG> our 
Heavenly Father has <STRONG>received exaltation</STRONG> and glory and he points 
us out the same path and, inasmuch as he is clothed with power, authority and 
glory, he says, “walk ye up and come in possession of <STRONG>the same 
glory</STRONG> and happiness that I possess.”<A class="super-2" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no120.htm#d3" 
name="rd3">[3]</A></P>
<P>However, the LDS view of a God who hasn’t always been God, and that man’s 
goal is to achieve the same level of godhood, would strike Christians as a great 
blasphemy. When God spoke to Isaiah, one of the great prophets of the Old 
Testament, He declared:</P>
<P class="quote-timesfont"><EM>I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me 
there is no God.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is there a God beside me; yea, there is no 
God; I</EM> <EM>know not any</EM>. (Isaiah&nbsp;44:6,&nbsp;8)</P>
<P class="quote-timesfont"><EM>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from everlasting to everlasting, 
thou art God</EM>. (Psalm&nbsp;90:2)</P>
<P class="quote-timesfont"><EM>I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst 
of thee</EM>. (Hosea&nbsp;11:9)</P>

<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Oct. 2012:</STRONG> Hi this is very interesting journey. by the way i 
just have to send a comment about your site wow it is a wealth of information. 
thank you for putting the time and effort in creating a website and thanks again 
for spending the time helping me and other Mormons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Oct. 2012:</STRONG> I wrote to you a few weeks ago when my brother 
was killed in an accident and his funeral was [conducted by Mormons]</P>
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thank YOU personally for, unknowingly, giving a stranger 
great comfort during this awful and deeply painful time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
YOUR VIDEOS, your kind face, your words, your comforting voice, when discussing 
this odd religion helped me stay strong and got me through those awful days 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. PS, your videos also helped another sister .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Oct. 2012:</STRONG> Leaving Mormonism is so difficult to do. You get 
so brainwashed into not thinking for yourself. I thank God every day that I saw 
the light. I thank him for Sandra’s part in my conversion.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Oct. 2012:</STRONG> It all started to come apart for me when I read 
<A 
href="http://utlm.org/booklist/titles/mormonismshadoworreality_ub001.htm"><EM>Mormonism: 
Shadow or Reality</EM></A> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. especially where it talks about 
Isaiah 29:4 being prophecy of the BoM. The first time I used a Strong’s 
Concordance, I looked up all bible passages about familiar spirits and realized 
Isa 29:4 couldn’t be a prophecy.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Oct. 2012:</STRONG> I’m a 20 year old from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I 
met the mormon church almost 4 years ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fortunately I 
discovered many FACTS that made me KNOW that that church (like any other I 
guess) is a corporation full of secrets and lies and its real “mission” is to 
concentrate power and money. Missionaries keep coming to my house and I try to 
be nice to them (it’s not their fault that they don’t even know their own 
church, because they are brainwashed since they are little), and I try to tell 
them why I think the way I think, with FACTS.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Oct. 2012:</STRONG> Today is the 1-year anniversary of the removal of 
my name from church records. I want to thank you for the help your website &amp; 
resources have given me. I believe you are called by God to help people like me 
find the true path to Jesus &amp; God, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> I stumbled across your website while surfing the 
internet, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It seems to me that your little group is based on hate 
and intolerance to another religion, much like the Christian persecution of the 
Jews and with all of the hate in the world, why create and operate some 
offensive and hateful in today’s world? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can honestly say that 
for you bigoted fools to hold onto such hate is pathetic 
b***s***.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Look up the definition of Christian and I 
guarantee you douche bags fall well outside those parameters and it’s time to 
grow up or shut up or don’t and reap what you sew.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> Years ago I had read that you were thinking of 
retiring .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I sent you an email and told you how important your 
ministry is, and asked you not to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am so glad that you 
reconsidered that thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are perhaps more needed now than 
ever .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. praise God for your ministry.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> Thank you for everything that you and Jerry have 
done to help break me free and clear my head. You and Jerry’s hard work brought 
me to a place to where I can think clearly and rationally.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
I would not be who I am today without you. Thank you.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> While I feel empathy for the Tanner family at the 
loss of Jerald, I would have loved to have seen the look on the face of Jerald 
when he crossed the veil and saw the Prophet Joseph Smith welcoming him. As a 
convert to the LDS Church, the efforts of people like the Tanner’s has only 
reinforced my testimony because greater is He that is within me [the Spirit] 
than he that is in the world.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> You were very instrumental in my conversion from 
LDS.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have some people in our church who are interested in 
trying to reach Mormons. Love you and your work.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> Id like to extend my thanks to you for all your 
work. It’s been vital to my search for the truths I was denied for 34 years. Im 
sharing my LDS membership resignation with you, as I did with Shawn and Alathea, 
because of how important you’ve all been to me and my final decision.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> If you dear people would put all the money you 
spend on the Salt Lake Messenger into doing good for others, taking care of your 
own, we would all be better off. We are all entitled to believe as we want to. 
Give it up! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Joseph Smith was &amp; is a Prophet.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Nov. 2012:</STRONG> Good morning.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thank you for 
the work you do. We are Christians who moved to Utah last year, unaware of what 
we were really coming to. It has been an unpleasant shock to learn what a 
God-less, spirit-less place this really is.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Dec. 2012:</STRONG> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose I’m sticking with the 
Mormons because I find them to be very pleasant and agreeable people.</P>
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway Madam, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you seem very polite and 
ladylike. I’ve watched some videos of your speeches and can’t help but be 
impressed by your skill in stating your case. Like I say, though, I still feel 
the presence of the Lord in Mormonism. These people have been good to me and I 
want to show them loyalty.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Dec. 2012:</STRONG> I wanted to tell you that UTLM has been such a 
valuable resource for me. I am an ex-mormon (BIC), and my husband and I left the 
church together after we married. I am teaching a 6 month series of classes to 
evangelical teens and adults on how to witness to the LDS, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your 
website provided me with one-stop shopping for these valuable materials, and I 
was especially delighted to see all the digital content now available.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Dec. 2012:</STRONG> Loved the latest issue of the SLC Messenger [<A 
class="noitalic" href="http://utlm.org/newsletters/no119.htm">November 
2012</A>]. You all did a wonderful job exposing the wackiness of Mormonism. This 
issue will for sure go into my library of false beliefs. Thank you for your hard 
work in bringing the true Jesus to the lost.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Jan. 2013:</STRONG> I know you must receive a wide variety of 
opinions, I want to encourage you to keep spreading the truth of God’s love. 
Speaking the truth in love can be difficult but you have done it well.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Jan. 2013:</STRONG> I’m writing to you because I have a deep 
appreciation for the work you and Jerald have done over the years. I’m amazed at 
the dedication you’ve shown in trying to help Mormons find 
truth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P>For 36 years now, I’ve been married to a wonderful, faithful, Mormon 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She wasn’t active in the church when we met in 1976, and we 
talked about her faith before getting married, resulting in her assuring me she 
wouldn’t go back to Mormonism. Well, as so often happens, when children come 
into our lives, we reach for our roots and that is what she 
did.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She insisted our kids be raised in the church as 
well.</P>
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This has been the only real problem (as a couple) that we’ve 
had in our marriage. The church has been between us since 1980 and we have (at 
times) struggled greatly with the division it has caused.</P>
<P>In 2009, I decided to give it my all to try and prove (once and for all) that 
the church was true so we could unite our family in Faith.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
What I found in my study of church history, and through daily Bible study, has 
born out what my gut was telling me all along, that Joseph Smith was a 
fraud.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P>Sandra, as a member of the body of Christ, I want you to know that I love 
you. You, your family, and Utah Lighthouse Ministry, are in my prayers always. 
Please pray for<U>&nbsp;&nbsp; </U>as well. I’m hopeful, in time, she will come 
to see truth. I continue to encourage her to read the New Testament, but, she 
almost seems to be afraid to actually do it. I don’t want you to worry, I don’t 
push her hard. I’ve learned I can drop a seed here and there, and not make her 
miserable.</P>
<P>Again, my main reason for writing is to say thanks! Ministries like yours are 
making a difference! Knowing the ONE TRUE GOD, is all that matters!</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Jan. 2013:</STRONG> After listening to you on a couple of TV 
programs, I can see that your understanding of Mormonism is limited.</P>
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Also, you told Jason Wallace and John Ankerberg that the 
Bible says that God has always been God. The Bible doesn’t say that. It says 
that “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from eternity to eternity, thou art God.” The LDS consider 
each of us as having existed “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from eternity to eternity.” So my 
son can say of me, “Dad, from eternity to eternity, thou art my father.” Note, 
that I haven’t been his father forever; but I HAVE existed from eternity, and 
will continue to exist for all eternity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . I believe your 
declaration that God is unchanging does not apply to ways He adapts to increased 
horizons.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Jan. 2013:</STRONG> I’m a brazilian member of the mormon church, my 
baptism was in 1980. I have various doubts about mormon’s doctrine, principal 
about Joseph Smith. I want to know documents copys for discuss about mormon 
history. Here in Brasil the members to know only official church&nbsp; 
history.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Jan. 2013:</STRONG> The In-law side of my family are largely 
polygamist mormons and I really love witnessing to them using information I 
receive from you.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Feb. 2013:</STRONG> God has said that the book of mormon is the most 
correct book and that by reading and living by it. (being the gospel and an 
additional witness of Christ) we could become closer to God. Realize that he 
didn’t say the perfect book, but the most correct. Information can only bring us 
to the desire to read or not to read to pray or not to pray about it. It is 
truly our choice, But we see that no evidence or archeology has ever sanctified 
the heart in knowing the truth and being converted to the Gospel of Christ, but 
by the Spirit of God.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Feb. 2013:</STRONG> On the previous testimony sunday on the 3rd of 
this month I bore my testimony saying “I know this church is false and I know 
Joseph Smith was not a prophet”.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the only thing I remember 
was a SIGH in the public in front of me, but I DID IT! I didn’t expect it to be 
such a relief after saying loud what I KNOW. After testifying I gave to my 
bishop the resignation letter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Feb. 2013:</STRONG> I accidentally came across your website. I and my 
husband left the church, 18 months ago. I joined the church in my 
twenties.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And eventually, went to the Temple. My experience 
there was very mixed. I was shocked in the endowment session, with the slitting 
of the throat, etc.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [prior to 1990] But each day I went along for 
a week and I rationalized it to be alright. Then I meet my husband<U>&nbsp; 
</U>[who] grew up in the church.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He loved reading FARMS and 
he subscribed to Dialogue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But with his learning of 
hieroglyphics he realized that the book of Abraham was 
false.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So we are now members of the Anglican Church, and my 
husband now smiles when he goes to church, we attend a bible study 
group.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can only pray that one day they [the rest of the 
family] will know The Lord.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Feb. 2013:</STRONG> You guys crack me up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why 
are you making it your life message to “debunk” Mormonism? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God 
has always led his people through prophets, so by what authority are you 
disseminating “information” in regards to His will? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you think 
you know better than divine revelation, well, by all means carry on. Sad, sad 
little people. So sorry to have chanced upon your website.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">

<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. THANK YOU THANK YOU</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Mar. 2013:</STRONG> Years ago your website was instrumental in 
freeing our family from Mormonism. You are doing a good work and helping a lot 
of people. Thank you so much for helping us.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Mar. 2013:</STRONG> THANK YOU for being a force for Christ in the 
world. The research that you and your husband provide makes a key difference in 
lives worldwide. In the limited times that I’ve had to talk and witness to 
Mormons, I know that information gotten from your newsletters really helped.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Mar. 2013:</STRONG> I am a Fancher descendant. Last weekend I visited 
the Mountain Meadows Massacre site with my two children. The experience was very 
moving for me and of course has resulted in many discussions among my family 
(some of whom are now Mormon), .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just wanted to say thank you 
for your work and commitment to truth.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Mar. 2013:</STRONG> I have to tell you, Sandra, that you have 
inspired me in many ways. When I was still a devout mormon, I thought what you 
were doing was just a lot of negative energy and time that would be better spent 
on something else. But that was because I didn’t want to see the truth of it 
yet. It would mean having the rug pulled out from under me, and having to make 
some very difficult decisions. But the time came when I had to acknowledge the 
truth, and could no longer support the lies of mormonism.</P>
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew Christ wouldn’t have had anything to do with it. And I 
came to realize the value of the gift of truth. Thank you for that.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Mar. 2013:</STRONG> Tanner(s), I have examined much of your “works” 
and find your scholarly abilities very much hindered by your personal agenda. I 
was converted to the Mormon Church and Baptized in 2008 after studying 
“Mormonism” for over 10 years. Your Anti- Mormon literature is good “tabloid” 
reading (I did enjoy most of what I read), but that is all it is—the “junk” of 
your cognitive fallacies.</P>
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The simple truth is you cannot prove the Book of Mormon was 
not brought forth by the gift and power of God. Please stop trying!</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Apr. 2013:</STRONG> Your ministry and message has helped me steer 
into truth much easier after leaving Mormonism on 12/13/12. My wife is still in 
it and has been since age 9, she is 51 now. You and Shawn McCraney have been 
very helpful with arming me with knowledge to defend my abrupt decision after 12 
years LDS to leave it. The Sunday school teacher from my wife’s ward is trying 
to rescue me. However it is my hope that his plan will backfire.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Apr. 2013:</STRONG> I am a Christian writing to you 
from<U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</U>UK. I recently found a second hand copy of your book <A href="http://utlm.org/booklist/titles/mormonismshadoworreality_ub001.htm"><EM>‘Mormonism: 
Shadow or reality’</EM></A> and bought it. I just wanted to write and say ‘thank 
you’ for this excellently researched resource. There is a Mormon church not far 
from where I live and a sizeable Mormon population in the area. Your book has 
enabled me to answer Mormon questions and better defend my faith. You and Mr 
Tanner did an amazing job</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Apr. 2013:</STRONG> Ms Tanner, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. many years ago when I 
was preparing to marry in the Oakland temple, a valued co-worker of mine loaned 
me a book of yours that had the ceremony word for word in it. I found it 
frightening at 19 and find it even more so now. My parents convinced me that I 
had nothing to worry about so I stuffed it down and went through with it. I wish 
I had believed what you wrote. I did not have the courage to completely disavow 
the church until I was already 5 years married to someone from whom I am 
(happily) divorced after 23 years.</P></DIV>
<DIV class="letters">
<P><STRONG>Apr. 2013:</STRONG> Since moving here [Nevada], I have been making 
friends with the LDS, having them over for meals and attending events with them, 
such as General Conference and church services (the whole 3 hours!) God had put 
it in my heart to get involved in a ministry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway, thank 
you again, Sandra. Your newsletters, videos and website have been invaluable to 
me.</P></DIV>
