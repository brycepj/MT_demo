  <H3>Introduction - How This Article Came About</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; My interest in language in general and foreign languages in 
  particular began when I was a child. &nbsp; When I was in high school I took 
  every foreign language the school offered (Latin and Spanish), and when I 
  began college I continued that study, with the intention of becoming a 
  language teacher. &nbsp; I continued with Spanish, and also learned French and 
  German, graduating with a major in German and minors in Spanish and English. 
  &nbsp; My master of arts degree was in German, after which I began to teach 
  (Latin, German and English). &nbsp; During that time I also studied Russian. 
  &nbsp; I then had the opportunity to work toward a doctorate in historical and 
  comparative linguistics, and spent four years in graduate school, learning 
  Anglo-Saxon, Old Icelandic, Gothic, Sanskrit, classical Greek, Old and Middle 
  High German, as well as extensively studying comparative and historical 
  linguistic methodology. &nbsp; In the years since I have also studied Mandarin 
  Chinese, Esperanto and Hebrew, and acquired a reading knowledge of Dutch and 
  Italian. &nbsp; During my teaching career of thirty-five years I used 
  comparative linguistic techniques in the classroom. &nbsp; I have found that 
  my knowledge and experience with the phenomena of language give me a somewhat 
  unusual perspective on Mormonism.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This article gathers together my 
  own observations as well as comments of others. &nbsp; Some of these problems 
  are well-known, but some of them I have never seen discussed before. &nbsp; So 
  far as I am aware, nowhere else has Mormonism been critiqued solely from a 
  linguistic point of view, gathering together all of the linguistic problems in 
  one place.
  <P><A name=INTRO2>
  <H3>The Importance Of Language in Mormonism</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of Mormonism, was also fascinated 
  with language from the very beginning of his career. &nbsp; He was raised in a 
  culture which believed in folk magic and the powers of language and mystical 
  words. &nbsp; (See D. Michael Quinn's <CITE>Early Mormonism and the Magic 
  World View </CITE>(2d ed.) and John L. Brooke's<CITE>The Refiner's 
  Fire</CITE>). &nbsp; His very first major venture into religious matters was a 
  purported translation of golden plates delivered to him (he said) by an angel 
  and written in a hitherto unknown language ("reformed Egyptian"), which he 
  claimed to be able to translate through the power of God. &nbsp; When he later 
  organized a church, he included among the titles and powers of the head of his 
  church that of "translator": 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"[The president of the church is]...to be a seer, a 
    revelator, a <B>translator</B>, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God 
    which he bestows upon the head of the church.</I>" [emphasis added]. 
    (<CITE>Doctrine and Covenants</CITE> [D&amp;C] 107:92, see also D&amp;C 
  21:1)</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Joseph Smith gained confidence 
  during his career as the head of a growing church, he continued to be 
  fascinated with languages, and he continued to translate. &nbsp; Even though 
  he claimed that he possessed (as head of the church) the divine power to 
  translate other languages (implicitly without actually studying them ), he 
  spent considerable effort to study other languages in the ordinary, non-divine 
  way. &nbsp; He hired tutors in Hebrew, and studied modern languages such as 
  German. &nbsp; He occasionally showed off his supposed knowledge of foreign 
  languages, as in his "Appeal to the Freemen of the State of Vermont," where he 
  demonstrated his linguistic ability by writing in seventeen different 
  languages (quoted in Fawn Brodie, <CITE>No Man Knows My History: The Life of 
  Joseph Smith</CITE>, p. 292).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to the <I>Book of 
  Mormon</I>, he made several other "translations": 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>The <CITE>Book of Abraham</CITE>, from some Egyptian papyrus scrolls 
    which came into his possession in 1835. &nbsp; He stated that the scrolls 
    were written by the biblical Abraham "by his own hand". &nbsp; Smith's 
    translation is now accepted as scripture by the LDS church, as part of its 
    <CITE>Pearl of Great Price</CITE>. &nbsp; Smith also produced an "Egyptian 
    Grammar" based on his translation. &nbsp; The scrolls are authentic Egyptian 
    scrolls, and are now in the possession of the Mormon church. &nbsp; A 
    companion scroll to the "Abraham" scroll was identified by Smith as the 
    "Book of Joseph," who was sold into Egypt (Gen 37). &nbsp; Smith never got 
    around to "translating" that scroll, and no Mormon prophet - even though 
    supposedly holding the divine office of "translator" - has attempted to do 
    so. &nbsp; (More about this <A 
    href="http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#BOA">below</A>.) 
    <P></P>
    <LI>The "Inspired Version" of the King James Bible, also called the "Joseph 
    Smith Translation" (JST). &nbsp; Smith said that he was commanded by God to 
    retranslate the Bible because the existing translations contained errors 
    (See D&amp;C 45:60-61, 90:13). He completed his translation in 1833, but the 
    church still uses the King James Version. &nbsp; Although Smith called it a 
    "translation," he did not actually consult any Hebrew or Greek texts, but 
    simply revised the King James Version. 
    <P></P>
    <LI>The "Kinderhook Plates," a group of six metal plates with strange 
    engraved characters, unearthed in 1843 near Kinderhook, Illinois, and 
    examined by Smith, who began a "translation" of them. &nbsp; He never 
    completed the translation, but he translated enough to identify the plates 
    as an "ancient record," and to identify the author as a "a descendant of 
    Ham, through the loins of Pharaoh, king of Egypt." &nbsp; &nbsp; Local 
    farmers later revealed that they had manufactured, engraved and buried the 
    plates themselves as a hoax. (See the <CITE>History of the Church</CITE> 
    5:372-378, where the editor defends their genuineness[!]. &nbsp; And see <A 
    href="http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#PHARAOH">below</A> about "Pharaoh" 
    as the name of an Egyptian king. &nbsp; ).
    <P></P>
    <LI>A "parchment" written by Jesus' disciple John (the "beloved") and 
    "hidden up" by him. &nbsp; This appears as D&amp;C section 7. &nbsp; Smith 
    did not claim to have actual possession of the parchment, but was still able 
    to "translate" it. &nbsp; Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley cites this feat as 
    proof that it is not necessary for a prophet of God to have the actual 
    original in front of him in order to translate. Although this "translation" 
    was published in the <CITE>Book of Commandments</CITE> in 1833, the entire 
    content of which was certified by God to be "correct" (D&amp;C 1:6, 67:4), 
    when it was republished in 1835 in the <CITE>Doctrine And Covenants</CITE> 
    (D&amp;C) it had undergone <A 
    href="http://www.2think.org/hundredsheep/boc/boc6.shtml">major 
    revisions</A>. </LI></UL>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although every president of the 
  Mormon church supposedly holds all the authority and powers granted by God to 
  Joseph Smith (<CITE>Doctrine and Covenants</CITE> 107:92), none of them has 
  ventured to exercise the divine power to translate.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even ordinary members of the 
  church were promised linguistic gifts, the ancient "gift of tongues," by which 
  the faithful could speak in languages they did not know, and interpret the 
  sayings of others who spoke in strange languages (D&amp;C 46:24-25, 109:36). 
  &nbsp; Many instances of "speaking in tongues" are recorded from the early 
  days of Mormonism. &nbsp; In modern times, however, Mormons seem to be content 
  with seeing that "gift" in the fact that their missionaries successfully study 
  foreign languages to be able to preach in other countries.
  <P><A name=PRELIM>
  <H3>Some Further Preliminary Considerations</H3><A name=TRANSLATED>
  <H4>"Translated by the power of God"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; If God is in fact involved in providing translations through his chosen 
  servants, and if God has specifically called such servants to be 
  "translators", one can assume that God has a purpose in doing so, and that the 
  purpose must obviously be to furnish mankind with important messages. &nbsp; 
  It cannot serve God's purposes if those translators are in fact unable to 
  provide accurate translations of the sacred material. &nbsp; Surely, if God is 
  at work here, the translations will be accurate and reliable. &nbsp; Man's 
  frailty or inabilities cannot be a frustration to the work of an omnipotent 
  God, one would think. &nbsp; And D&amp;C 3:3 reiterates that idea: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is 
    frustrated, but the work of men;..." </I></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One should be able to assume, then, that God is a master 
  of all the world's languages, and that if we find mistranslations or ignorance 
  of the meanings of words, or inability to express an idea accurately, we are 
  <EM>not</EM> dealing with a message from God, but a message from someone who 
  merely <EM>claims</EM> to be speaking for God.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormons will probably cite as an 
  excuse for such errors the passage in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> (BoM), 
  which says (Mormon 8:17)<CITE> "And if there be faults [in this record] they 
  be the faults of a man...."</CITE>. &nbsp; They do not seem to realize that 
  such an admission implies that any faults mean that - at least at that point - 
  the man was <EM>not</EM> inspired by God. Notice, too, that "Mormon" is 
  referring to the text that <EM>he</EM> is supposedly writing, not the 
  translation to be made centuries later.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormon apologists who try to deal 
  with the many translation problems often try to excuse and explain the 
  problems by showing how translating is an inaccurate art, how difficult it is, 
  how translators are hampered by the inexact correspondence of one language 
  with another. &nbsp; All of which is very true, if one is looking at a 
  translation done by a translator who was working with <EM>no</EM> divine 
  assistance. &nbsp; But none of those excuses can apply to Joseph Smith, who, 
  although he was called the "translator," was merely supposed to be acting as 
  God' secretary. &nbsp; Accounts of the "translation" process which produced 
  the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> describe how the divine power would not let 
  him proceed past a phrase until God considered it <EM>correct</EM>. &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, Mormon scholars, in 
  attempting to deal with their inability to find certain cultural artifacts in 
  ancient America which are described in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>, 
  unwittingly <EM>deny</EM> the role of God in the translation process, since 
  they have to insist that certain words are <EM>mistranslated</EM>:

  <H4>Anachronisms - A Sure Proof of Fraud</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Probably ever since mankind began to write, there have been 
  those who have tried to take advantage of the power of the written word by 
  passing off their own writings, which would not have much credence if their 
  true authorship were known, as the writings of someone with more authority, 
  especially some long-dead authority. &nbsp; There are hundreds, if not 
  thousands, of such examples in the documentary history of mankind: the 
  "Donation of Constantine," or the "Songs of Ossian," to name just two 
  non-religious works. &nbsp; In ancient times it was very common, and perhaps 
  not even considered dishonest, to publish such a pseudepigraph: most of the 
  biblical Apocryphal books are pseudepigrapha, and even some of the canonical 
  books of the Bible are considered by many Bible scholars to have been written 
  by someone other than the author whose name is associated with it (the 
  Epistles of Peter, the Book of Daniel, the last part of Isaiah, some of the 
  "Pauline" epistles, and others). &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, it is often important, 
  in deciding whether to trust what a document says, to know whether its 
  purported author really wrote it, or whether it was written later (especially 
  much later) by someone else. &nbsp; Thus, techniques were developed by 
  scholars to test such texts, and these tests have proved to be remarkably 
  helpful and accurate.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most important tests 
  for uncovering an allegedly ancient text that is really a product of later 
  times is the presence of anachronisms, that is, things that are inappropriate 
  to the time in which the work supposedly was written. &nbsp; It is a very 
  straightforward and relatively common-sense test.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For example: Suppose I show you a 
  small book that says on its cover: "Journal of Gen'l George Washington." You 
  look through the book and at first reading it does, indeed, appear to be the 
  journal of a period in the life of George Washington. &nbsp; What a treasure! 
  It sounds authentic. &nbsp; Its language is typical of the late 18th century, 
  when Washington lived. &nbsp; It contains material hitherto unknown to 
  historians, and yet not contradictory to what is known. &nbsp; I explain to 
  you that it is a faithful typewritten copy of a handwritten book that was 
  found among my grandfather's belongings.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you read it, however, you come 
  across this sentence: "This aft'noon rec'd an urgent wire, took the rr train 
  to Philadelphia, arr'd toward evening, met by M. Adams at the sta." &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is your reaction? &nbsp; Are 
  you suspicious? &nbsp; You know that the railroad did not exist in 
  Washington's day, nor did the term "rr train" or "sta[tion]" as a place where 
  one would meet a "rr train." &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor was a message called a "wire", 
  since that term came into use only with the invention of the telegraph in the 
  next century. &nbsp; These are <EM>anachronisms</EM>, and immediately mark the 
  text as <EM>not</EM> from the times of Washington.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What explanation could I give you 
  that would persuade you to accept this text as genuine? &nbsp; I could 
  probably try to defend the authenticity of my text. &nbsp; I could suggest 
  that "rr train" was probably a special shorthand Washington was using for 
  "stagecoach" (even though there is no evidence of such a use in any genuine 
  Washington writings, or in any other writings from the time). &nbsp; A similar 
  argument might be made for "wire" for a message. &nbsp; But to any scholar, 
  and to any ordinary person using common sense and a rudimentary knowledge of 
  history, this text is a clumsy fraud.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would you change your mind if I 
  listed all the things that <EM>are</EM> authentic in the text, or that sound 
  believable or possible? &nbsp; No, I would hope not.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would you change your mind if I 
  argued that, after all, it was only two little anachronisms? &nbsp; No, I 
  would hope not. &nbsp; Even only one anachronism - unless it can be 
  conclusively shown to be a later insertion by someone else (a corruption of 
  the original text) - is enough to condemn a text as not authentic.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would you change your mind if I 
  confided to you that the journal had been given to my grandfather by an angel 
  of God, and that the angel had told him that it was authentic? &nbsp; I 
  suppose to some people that would make a difference, but only the very, very 
  gullible.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The examples given above are of 
  anachronistic <EM>objects</EM>. &nbsp; A <EM>linguistic anachronism</EM> is 
  the use of a <EM>word</EM> which actually did not come into use until much 
  later than the alleged date of the document. &nbsp; For example, if we found 
  in the purported journal of Washington the expression "fifth column" (meaning 
  undercover sabotage agents), we would know that the journal is not authentic, 
  since that expression was coined and first used during the Spanish Civil War 
  in the twentieth century. &nbsp; Many of the anachronisms in Mormon scriptures 
  are of this type, as will be illustrated below.
  <P><A name=KINGJAMES>
  <H4>"King James" Style</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An 
  observant reader of the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> quickly notices that the 
  style of English used there is similar to that of the King James Authorized 
  translation of the Bible, with "thee" and "thou" and verb phrases like "hath 
  seen" or frequent use of "behold." &nbsp; &nbsp; Modern Bible translations 
  generally avoid archaic language and use contemporary language instead. &nbsp; 
  And, of course, when the King James translators were writing their 
  translation, they <I>were</I> writing in contemporary language, the language 
  of England in 1611.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why would the <CITE>Book of 
  Mormon</CITE> - also purportedly a translation of an ancient record, like the 
  Bible - not be translated into the modern language of the translator (i.e., 
  the American language of 1829)? &nbsp; Why use a form of English that had 
  disappeared (except for the King James Bible) from daily use? &nbsp; True, in 
  the 19th century it was not uncommon for translations of ancient secular works 
  (such a Greek drama, Latin poetry, Norse epics) to use an antiquated form of 
  English, for the purpose of emphasizing the antiquity of the original.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that may be the reason for 
  Joseph Smith's use of archaic English in his translation. &nbsp; However, that 
  does not explain why the revelations in the <CITE>Doctrine and 
  Covenants</CITE> appear in the same archaic English. &nbsp; They do not 
  purport to be ancient documents, but modern. &nbsp; Remember, too, that God

  God's own words, not filtered, and not translated:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CITE>"These words are not of men nor of man, but of me."</CITE> 
    - <SMALL>- D&amp;C 18:34</SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>One gets the impression that 
  Smith's familiarity with the King James Bible led him to believe that when God 
  speaks English, it's got to be the English of 1611. &nbsp; But <I>why</I>? 
  &nbsp; Why would God speak in that particular style of English? &nbsp; But 
  that seems to be the rather pervasive belief among Mormons, who consider it 
  improper to use anything but King James English when praying. &nbsp; Mormon 
  leaders sometimes suggest that such a style of speaking is more "sacred."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They have insisted that prayers 
  should address God with "thee" and "thou" rather than "you" because, they say, 
  "thee" and "thou" are more "respectful" than "you." &nbsp; &nbsp; This shows 
  an ignorance of the history of the differing forms, as well as of the use of 
  the equivalent forms in other modern languages which still use them (German, 
  French, Spanish, etc.). &nbsp; The "you" form (as well as "ye") is originally 
  the plural form for "thee" and "thou," and the use of the plural when speaking 
  to only one person began (relatively recently) as a sign of respect, whereas 
  "thee" and "thou" (often called the "familiar" forms) did <I>not</I> 
  necessarily indicate respect, but rather familiarity or the superior social 
  status of the speaker. &nbsp; As it became customary to show more and more 
  respect to more and more people, "you" in English gradually supplanted the 
  singular forms entirely in daily use. &nbsp; Thus the Mormons have it 
  backwards.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most damaging argument 
  against asserting that the words in the <CITE>Book of Mormon </CITE>and 
  (especially) the <CITE>Doctrine and Covenants</CITE> are the actual words of 
  God, speaking in the English of 1611, is that the King James English of those 
  scriptures is full of grammatical errors. Does God make gross grammatical 
  errors in his chosen language?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The English of 1611 had its 
  grammatical rules, many of which were quite different from the grammatical 
  rules of modern English. Although they were not always as strictly observed by 
  the English of that time, there was not a lot of latitude. Many usages we now 
  consider "correct English" were barely coming into use then, and were thus 
  "incorrect." For example, "thou" "thee," "thy," and "thine" were used to refer 
  only to the single (singular) person being addressed; "ye," "you," "your" and 
  "yours" were used only when addressing more than one person, or a person to 
  whom great respect was due. ("Ye" was the subject form, "you" the object 
  form.) They were not interchangeable, any more than "I" and "we" are 
  interchangeable in modern English. Nor were "ye" and "you" interchangeable, 
  any more than "they" and "them."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "He has" is modern English. No 
  Elizabethan would say that, but rather "he hath." ("Has" does not occur at all 
  in the King James Bible, but 134 times in the <CITE>Doctrine and 
  Covenants</CITE>, along with 100 occurrences of "hath.") The correct 
  possessive for "it" in King James' time was not "its," as in modern English, 
  but "his." (See the first chapter of Genesis for numerous examples.)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surely if God were speaking 
  modern English, he would not say things like "you is" or "we am," "Are Joseph 
  here? Yes, they art." Nor would he arbitrarily switch from archaic English to 
  modern English, often within the same sentence. And yet that is precisely the 
  kind of ungrammatical imitation of King James English in Mormon scriptures. 
  Here are some examples (thanks for many of these to Dr. Kent Ponder; emphasis 
  added in all quotations):
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
    <LI>In D&amp;C 3:10 God is speaking to Joseph only: "...repent of what 
    <I>thou</I> hast done, which is contrary to the commandment which I gave 
    <I>you</I>, and <I>thou</I> art still chosen..." (unnecessary switching from 
    singular to plural and back again)
    <P></P>
    <LI>In D&amp;C 6 God speaks to Oliver Cowdery, especially from v. 16 on. 
    From verses 16 to 20, God addresses Oliver correctly with the singular forms 
    "thou," "thee," etc. But from verse 21 to the end, he addressed Oliver 
    incorrectly with the "you" (plural) forms. Similar switching back and forth 
    are in sections 8 and 9.
    <P></P>
    <LI>At D&amp;C 6:16 God says, "...there is none else save God that 
    <I>knowest</I> thy thoughts..." It should be "knoweth," of course: "knowest" 
    can only be used if "thou" is the subject: "thou knowest."
    <P></P>
    <LI>At D&amp;C 105:1 God says, "“Verily I say unto you who have assembled 
    yourselves here that <I>you</I> may learn my will....” (incorrect use of 
    "you" as subject.)
    <P></P>
    <LI>In D&amp;C 10 God is speaking to Joseph Smith. In the first fourteen 
    verses he addresses Smith using the plural forms of "you" a total of 28 
    times. Then in verse 15 he correctly reverts to the singular: “..[Satan] has 
    put it into their hearts to get <I>thee</I> to tempt the Lord <I>thy</I> 
    God, ..”
    <P></P></LI></UL>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same kinds of 
  error are also frequent in the other Mormon scriptures:
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>2 Nephi 1:30-32, Lehi speaks to Zoram (as divinely translated by God's 
    inspired translator): "And now, Zoram, I speak unto <I>you:</I> Behold, 
    <I>thou art</I> the servant of Laban...if <I>ye</I> shall keep the 
    commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the 
    security of <I>thy</I> seed with the seed of my son." (incorrect switching 
    between singular and plural)
    <P></P>
    <LI>2 Nephi 3:1, Lehi says: "And now I speak unto <I>you</I>, Joseph, my 
    last-born. <I>Thou wast</I> born in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, 
    in the days of my greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee. (incorrect 
    switching between singular and plural)
    <P></P>
    <LI>Mosiah 2:19-20, King Benjamin says: "O how <I>you</I> ought to thank 
    your heavenly King! ... if <I>you</I> should render all the thanks and 
    praise..." (object form used as subject; should be "ye"; also verses 21, 34, 
    40, also 4:10, 21, 5:15. More examples of "you" incorrectly used as a 
    subject: Mosiah 12:25, 30; 13:10; 18:10, 13; 24:14; 29:13; Alma 5:6, 16, 19, 
    20, 22, 55; 7:6, 17, 27; 9:18; 32:28, 30, 34; 37:16; 38:2; many others)
    <P></P>
    <LI>Alma 36 through 42 contain Alma's advice to his sons, each chapter 
    addressed individually to the named son.. He repeatedly uses "ye" and "you" 
    (plural) rather than the singular "thou" and "thee", although occasionally 
    also using the singular (as in 36:3)
    <P></P></LI></UL>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are only a 
  sampling of hundreds of other examples that could be cited, where God (or 
  God's divinely inspired translator) is ungrammatical. Over the years, the 
  Mormon church has corrected over 3,000 errors in grammar, spelling, 
  punctuation and awkward wording in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> since its 
  first publication in 1830, such things as "they was," "he seen," which would 
  have been obviously incorrect to an educated speaker of modern English. One 
  would think they would correct the many violations of King James era grammar 
  as well. Especially if that style of English is God's preferred language when 
  communicating with modern English speakers.

  <H3>Specific Language Problems in Mormonism</H3></CENTER>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will now discuss some of the many linguistic problems 
  in Mormonism which show that its linguistic claims do not withstand close 
  examination.
  <P><A name=MORMON>
  <H4>The word "Mormon"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word 
  'mormo' or 'mormon' can be found in any dictionary of classical Greek. It 
  means "scarecrow, bugbear, ghost, demon."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apparently someone who knew some 
  Greek tried to make something of this, and Joseph Smith responded with a 
  "letter to the editor": 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Editor of the Times and Seasons:
    <P>SIR: --Through the medium of your paper I wish to correct an error among 
    men that profess to be learned, liberal and wise; and I do it the more 
    cheerfully because I hope sober-thinking and sound-reasoning people will 
    sooner listen to the voice of truth than be led astray by the vain 
    pretensions of the self-wise.
    <P>The error I speak of is the definition of the word "Mormon." It has been 
    stated that this word was derived from the Greek word mormo. This is not the 
    case. <B>There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates</B> from which I, 
    through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon. Let the 
    language of the book speak for itself. ...
    <P>Before I give a definition, however, to the word, let me say that the 
    Bible in its widest sense, means good; for the Savior says according to the 
    gospel of John, "I am the good shepherd" and it will not be beyond the 
    common use of terms, to say that <B>good</B> is among the most important in 
    use, and though known by various names in different languages, still its 
    meaning is the same, and is ever in opposition to bad. We say from the 
    Saxon, good; the Dane, god; the Latin, bonus; the Greek, kalos; the Hebrew, 
    tob; and the <B>Egyptian, mon. Hence, with the addition of more, or the 
    contraction, mor, we have the word MORMON; which means, literally, more 
    good</B>.
    <P>Yours,<BR>JOSEPH SMITH.</I>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Several questions arise:
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Joseph Smith was simply 
  translating by the power of God, without actually having to know the foreign 
  language(s) from which he was translating, how did he know that there was no 
  Latin or Greek? &nbsp; Since Smith did not know any Latin or Greek at the time 
  he was "translating" the plates, it must have been God who told him that there 
  was no Latin or Greek in the plates. &nbsp; (Remember this statement for 
  later!)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How does a modern English word 
  ("more") come to be part of an ancient Nephite (or Egyptian?) name?
  <P><A name=ISAIAH>
  <H4>"Isaiah" and "Esaias"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 
  name of the Old Testament prophet Isaiah appears in its Hebrew form 
  (Anglicized as 'Isaiah') only in the Old Testament (in fact, Isaiah is 
  mentioned in the Old Testament only in the historical books of Kings and 
  Chronicles, and in the book bearing his name). &nbsp; Because the New 
  Testament writers wrote in Greek, not Hebrew, whenever New Testament writers 
  referred to this prophet, they used the Greek form of the name: 'Esaias.' The 
  King James Version, which is the only version of the Bible Joseph Smith knew, 
  also uses the Greek version of the name, anglicized as 'Esaias' rather than 
  the Hebrew form 'Isaiah.' Most modern translations of the New Testament use 
  the form 'Isaiah' rather than 'Esaias' so as to make clear to the reader that 
  it is the Old Testament prophet Isaiah that is being referred to. &nbsp; The 
  name 'Esaias' thus occurs 21 times in the King James New Testament (but never 
  in the Old Testament), and in each instance the writer is referring back to a 
  prophecy of Isaiah. &nbsp; Examine some of those occurrences of 'Esaias' in 
  the KJV New Testament, and then check the Old Testament passages of Isaiah to 
  which they refer:

  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each of these King James New 
  Testament passages refers to the words of "Esaias" and then quotes the book of 
  Isaiah. &nbsp; It would seem obvious that in the minds of the New Testament 
  writers Isaiah and Esaias are one and the same.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But D&amp;C 84:11-13 says that 
  Esaias was a prophet who lived in the days of Abraham, many centuries before 
  Isaiah. &nbsp; And D&amp;C 76:100 distinguishes Esaias from Isaiah: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"...these are they who say they are some of one and some of 
    another; some of Christ; and some of John; and some of Moses; and some of 
    Elias; and some of <B>Esaias</B>; and some of <B>Isaiah</B>; ..."</I> 
    [emphasis added]</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Ezias" 
  also occurs in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> (Hel 8:20) in a list of 
  prophets who have testified to the coming of a savior, also as a 
  <EM>different</EM> prophet from Isaiah: <I>"Zenos... also Zenock, and also 
  <B>Ezias, and also Isaiah</B>,..."</I>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, according to Mormon 
  revelation through Joseph Smith, there was a prophet in the days of Abraham 
  who had a Greek name (several centuries before the Greek language had 
  developed), the same name as used by speakers of Greek two thousand years 
  later for the great prophet Isaiah, and who appears to be unknown to any bible 
  writer, but upon whom God personally conferred the priesthood. &nbsp; And his 
  prophecies of the coming savior are lost.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps God should have explained 
  to Joseph Smith that the same person's name can appear in different versions 
  in different languages, but it is still the same person: the king who is 
  called Charlemagne by the French and the English is the same person that the 
  Germans call Karl der Grosse; the emperor called Don Carlos by the Spaniards 
  is the same person we call Charles V.
  <P><A name=ELIJAH>
  <H4>"Elijah" and "Elias"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph 
  Smith's problem with 'Elijah' (Hebrew) and 'Elias' (Greek) is similar, but 
  more complicated.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The name 'Elijah' occurs in this 
  Hebrew form in the Bible (King James Translation) only in the Old Testament, 
  over sixty times. &nbsp; Almost all occurrences are in I and II Kings, but a 
  very important occurrence is in the prophecy in Malachi 4:5-6: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming 
    of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of 
    the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, 
    lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." </I></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Christian Bible, the Old Testament books 
  are arranged so that this verse is the last verse in the Old Testament, 
  emphasizing the Christian interpretation of this passage as a prophecy which 
  is fulfilled in the gospels immediately following. &nbsp; In the Jewish 
  arrangement of the scriptures, Malachi is the last of the minor prophets, and 
  is followed by the books called "Writings"; thus it is nowhere near the end of 
  the Hebrew scriptures. &nbsp; (For more problems with this passage, see <A 
  href="http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#MISTRANSLATIONS">below</A>.)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fame of Elijah rested not 
  only on his great life and the Malachi prophecy, but on the fact that he did 
  not die; he was carried into heaven without tasting death (II Kings 2:11). 
  &nbsp; It was perhaps this fact that allowed the Jews to accept the 
  possibility that Elijah would, in fact, return as Malachi prophesied, since 
  ordinarily the dead do not come back. &nbsp; Elijah, however, never having 
  actually died, could return.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The name in the form 'Elijah' 
  does not occur in the Greek New Testament, nor does 'Elias' occur in the Old 
  Testament. &nbsp; But 'Elias' occurs thirty times in the King James New 
  Testament , and almost always in reference to the Malachi prophecy. &nbsp; 
  John the Baptist was considered by many to be the returning Elijah. &nbsp; 
  Notice however that it is always 'Elias' that is spoken of (Matt 11:14, 16:14, 
  17:11, Mark 9:11-13, John 1:21, 25 and parallels - KJV). &nbsp; At Romans 
  11:2-3, Paul quotes 'Elias' with the words of Elijah from I Kings 19:14.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the Transfiguration, Moses and 
  'Elias' appear (Matt 17:3, Mark 9:4, Luke 9:30, KJV), and the disciples are 
  informed that "Elias has come" (Matt 17:12, Mark 9:12). &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most modern translations of the 
  New Testament use the Hebrew version of the name ('Elijah') instead of the 
  Greek 'Elias' in order to avoid confusion and to emphasize that these two 
  names refer to the <EM>same</EM> Old Testament prophet.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Joseph Smith obviously did 
  not know this, and apparently God didn't tell him: In D&amp;C 27:6-9, 'Elias' 
  and 'Elijah' are treated as distinctly different prophets: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"And also with <B>Elias</B>, to whom I have committed the 
    keys of bringing to pass the restoration of all things spoken by the mouth 
    of all the holy prophets since the world began, concerning the last 
    days;<BR>7 And also John the son of Zacharias, which Zacharias he (Elias) 
    visited and gave promise that he should have a son, and his name should be 
    John, and he should be filled with the spirit of Elias;<BR>8 Which John I 
    have sent unto you, my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, to 
    ordain you unto the first priesthood which you have received, that you might 
    be called and ordained even as Aaron;<BR>9 And <B>also Elijah</B>, unto whom 
    I have committed the keys of the power of turning the hearts of the fathers 
    to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, that the 
    whole earth may not be smitten with a curse;..." </I>[emphasis added] (see 
    also D&amp;C 138:45-46)</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Both Elias and Elijah also are reported to have appeared as two separate 
  beings in the Kirtland temple (D&amp;C 110:12, 13): 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"12 After this, <B>Elias</B> appeared, and committed the 
    dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all 
    generations after us should be blessed.<BR>13 After this vision had closed, 
    <B>another</B> great and glorious vision burst upon us; for <B>Elijah</B> 
    the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, 
    and said:<BR>14 Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the 
    mouth of Malachi--..." </I>[emphasis added]</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, for Joseph Smith, the Greek name referred to one 
  prophet and the Hebrew name referred to another.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This has caused no end of trouble 
  for Mormon theologians. &nbsp; Mormon apostle and theologian Bruce R. 
  McConkie, in <CITE>Mormon Doctrine,</CITE> takes more than three pages to try 
  to unravel the contradictions. &nbsp; He distinguishes five (!) meanings for 
  "Elias":
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>1. A prophet of Abraham's time (D&amp;C 110:12) and the "spirit" 
    or "doctrine" of this prophet; McConkie admits that "We have no information, 
    at this time, as to the mortal life or ministry of Elias. &nbsp; It is 
    apparent that he lived in the days of Abraham, but whether he was Abraham 
    [!], or Melchizedek, or some other prophet, we do not know."<BR><BR>2. The 
    Greek form of 'Elijah'; McConkie says, "This leads to some confusion..." 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; (Yes, especially in the mind of Joseph Smith!)<BR><BR>3. The 
    Spirit and Doctrine of Elias, which is to prepare for a greater work to come 
    (this must therefore pertain only to the Aaronic priesthood, says 
    McConkie).<BR><BR>4. The Elias of the Restoration. &nbsp; According to 
    Joseph Smith, says McConkie, Christ is the Elias (JST "Inspired Version" 
    John 1:21-28). &nbsp; McConkie clarifies: "By revelation we are also 
    informed that the Elias who was to restore all things is the angel Gabriel 
    who was know in mortality as Noah. (D&amp;C 27:6-7) ... From the same 
    authentic source we also learn that the promised Elias is John the 
    Revelator. (D&amp;C 77:9, 14)." &nbsp; &nbsp; McConkie then concludes that 
    'Elias' is a "composite personage." &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a "name and a 
    title."<BR><BR>5. John the Baptist is a good example of an 'Elias,' says 
    McConkie.</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, which 
  explanation makes more sense and is more likely the case? &nbsp; McConkie's 
  (Elias is a hitherto unknown prophet of Abraham's time, with a Greek name, or 
  maybe Abraham himself, or Melchizedek, or Gabriel - who is also Noah - and 
  Christ, and Elijah, and John the Baptist, and John the Revelator, and a 
  "spirit or doctrine")? &nbsp; Or the more obvious conclusion that Joseph Smith 
  was simply ignorant of the fact that the King James New Testament uses the 
  Greek version of Old Testament names?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moral: all it takes is one stupid 
  mistake to form the basis for an entire complicated theology. 
  <P><A name=JEHOVAH>
  <H4>"Jehovah" and "Elohim"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a 
  doctrinal statement by the Mormon First Presidency "The Father and the Son" 
  (cited by Mormon theologian James Talmage in his <CITE>The Articles of 
  Faith</CITE>, pp. 465ff) the prophets state that "Elohim" refers to God the 
  Father, and "Jehovah" refers to God the Son. This distinction is also 
  portrayed in the Mormon temple ritual drama, the "endowment," where "Elohim" 
  gives instructions to "Jehovah and Michael" and sends them off to carry them 
  out, which they do.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a fundamental 
  mistranslation of the Hebrew scriptures.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exodus 6:2-3 says, translated 
  literally from Hebrew: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>2 And Elohim spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am YHWH

  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Hebrew word "Elohim" means 
  "God" and is translated in most English Bibles by "God," whereas "YHWH" - as 
  this passage indicates, is the sacred <EM>name</EM> of God, and is translated 
  in most English Bibles as "the LORD". In the Old Testament the terms are 
  almost interchangeable, and frequently one version of an Old Testament story 
  refers to the deity as "Elohim" (translated as "God") and another version of 
  the same story uses the term "YHWH" (translated as "the LORD"). There are 
  hundreds of such examples. &nbsp; In fact, it was the use of these different 
  terms in Hebrew for the deity that first led scholars to surmise that the 
  first five books of the Old Testament are from differing sources and 
  traditions: one that called God "Elohim", and another that called him "YHWH". 
  Here are just a few examples:
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Flood story, God is 
  referred to as "Elohim" in Gen 6:9-22; 7:9, 16; 8:1, 15. But God - apparently 
  the same God - is called "YHWH (Jehovah)" in 6:5-7; 7:1-5, 16; 8:20. In God's 
  dealings with Abraham, God is called "Elohim" in Genesis 17, but "YHWH" in 
  Genesis 18. It is clear that these are not two different personages, but just 
  one God, referred to by two different terms. &nbsp; Hundreds of other examples 
  could be cited. (See any analytical concordance under "God" and "Lord" for a 
  complete listing.)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Hebrew word 'elohim' is 
  grammatically the plural of the noun 'el' or 'eloi', which was the Semitic 
  word meaning "god." &nbsp; &nbsp; It is the same root as in the Arabic word 
  "Allah." &nbsp; &nbsp; Scholars believe that the Hebrews adopted the word from 
  their neighbors the Canaanites, since "El" was the name of one of their chief 
  gods.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph Smith, after he began to 
  study Hebrew with a Hebrew teacher and later began to delve into the Jewish 
  occultism in the Kabbalah, made much of the fact that the word "Elohim" is 
  grammatically plural, and used that to justify his doctrine of the plurality 
  of gods. &nbsp; This is reflected in his <CITE>Book of Abraham</CITE>, where 
  "the gods" are reported to have created the world (Abraham 3), whereas the 
  corresponding passages of his (equally inspired?) <CITE>Book of Moses</CITE> 
  (Moses 2), the creator reports that "I, God, said, Let there be light [etc.]"
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For an extensive discussion about 
  Smith's sources for this interpretation of "Elohim," see "Joseph Smith and 
  Kabbalah: The Occult Connection" by Lance S. Owens, in <CITE>Dialogue: A 
  Journal of Mormon Thought, </CITE>Vol. 27, No. 3, Fall 1994, pp. 117-194, also 
  online <A href="http://www.webcom.com/~gnosis/jskabb3.htm">here</A>.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, Joseph Smith again assumes 
  that two different names must signify two different personages.
  <P><A name=CHRIST>
  <H4>"Christ the Messiah"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not 
  many people are aware of the fact that the word "Messiah" is used in the King 
  James Translation of the Old Testament only twice: in chapter 9 of the book of 
  Daniel (written in the second century B.C.). &nbsp; The Greek transliteration 
  ("Messias") of this Hebrew word is used only twice in the New Testament, in 
  the Gospel of John (1:41 and 4:25).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Hebrew word which gives us 
  the term "messiah" is 'mashiach,' meaning literally "[the] anointed [one]" and 
  is used 47 times in the Hebrew Old Testament, in reference to <EM>all</EM> 
  anointed persons: priests, kings, etc. &nbsp; It is only relatively late in 
  Hebrew literature that it came to have the additional special meaning of the 
  yet-to-come anointed king of the house of David who was expected to appear and 
  free the Jews from foreign domination and establish God's kingdom forever on 
  earth, and thus also end the world as we know it.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Usually in the New Testament, 
  which was written in Greek, the Hebrew word 'mashiach' is translated into 
  Greek with the Greek word which means "anointed": 'christos', and that Greek 
  word is usually not translated into English, but only transliterated 
  (anglicized), as "Christ," with a capital letter.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the fundamental teachings 
  of Christianity, of course (and I am including Mormonism here, since Mormons 
  share this view), is that Jesus was that promised Messiah (or "anointed 
  [king]"). &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Greek of the New 
  Testament, of course, he was referred to as "Jesus the Anointed One" ('Iesous 
  ho christos'), which in Hebrew or Aramaic would be something like "Ieshua ha 
  mashiach."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, when we look at the 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> (supposedly translated from Hebrew written in 
  "Reformed Egyptian"), we find that the term "Messiah" occurs about 25 times. 
  &nbsp; The term "Christ" occurs about 317 times.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Several questions arise:
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the difference, for the 
  Book of Mormon author(s), between the Hebrew word "messiah" and the Greek word 
  "christ"? &nbsp; (Especially when Joseph Smith insisted that there were no 
  Greek words in the Book of Mormon.) Why is the Hebrew word used sometimes, but 
  the Greek word at other times? Remember, these authors are supposedly Jews who 
  knew no Greek! Were there two different Nephite (i.e. "Reformed Egyptian") 
  words in the original text, one to be translated as "Messiah" and the other as 
  "Christ"? &nbsp; If so, what was the difference in their meaning, and what was 
  their origin? 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The confusion is compounded in 2 
  Nephi 25:19, where Nephi writes: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>For according to the words of the prophets, the 
    <B>Messiah</B> cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left 
    Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of 
    the angel of God, <B>his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</B></I> 
    [emphasis added]</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Putting aside for the moment the 
  question "What Old Testament prophets said that the messiah would be named 
  Jesus Christ?" we would like to ask what this passage must have looked like in 
  "Reformed Egyptian," since it is translating two occurrences of the same word 
  ("the anointed one") in different ways, one with the Greek word "Christ" and 
  one with the Hebrew word "Messiah." Why?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another question is why Nephi 
  would think that the word "Christ" is a "name"! It is not a name, even though 
  many Sunday School children think of it as a name ("Jesus Christ was the son 
  of Joseph Christ and Mary Christ"). It is a title. &nbsp; This passage is like 
  saying "The name of the Father of our country was President Washington." 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whoever wrote the Book of Mormon 
  seemed to have Greek and Hebrew words at his disposal, but he did not 
  understand their meaning. &nbsp; Does that sound like God? &nbsp; Or Nephi? 
  &nbsp; Or Joseph Smith?
  <P><A name=GREEK>
  <H4>More Greek in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE></H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember that Joseph Smith said that there was "no Greek 
  or Latin" in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>. &nbsp; And it should 
  <EM>not</EM> contain any Greek or Latin, since neither of those languages were 
  familiar to the inhabitants of Palestine before Lehi supposedly left Jerusalem 
  about 600 B.C. &nbsp; However, as we shall see, there are <EM>many</EM> Greek 
  words in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>, and that fact must cast doubt on the 
  claim that it was written by Jews who broke off all contact with their 
  homeland in about 590 B.C. &nbsp; Historically, the Greek language was not 
  used in Palestine until after the conquest of the Middle East by Alexander the 
  Great, in 325 B.C., long after Lehi had left. &nbsp; Latin did not come into 
  use in Palestine until the first century B.C. &nbsp; Thus, any Greek or Latin 
  words in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> are linguistic anachronisms.
  <P><A name=CHURCH>
  <H4>"Church" and "synagogue"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 
  the BoM at 1 Nephi 4:24-26 is this passage, where Nephi has just beheaded 
  Laban, and has disguised himself in Laban's (miraculously non-bloody) 
  clothing. He is speaking to Laban's servant: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>24 And I also spake unto him that I should carry the 
    engravings, which were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who 
    were without the walls.<BR>25 And I also bade him that he should follow 
    me.<BR>26 And he, supposing that I spake of the <B>brethren of the 
    church</B>, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he 
    did follow me.</I> [emphasis added]</BLOCKQUOTE>Does that sound odd? 
  (Remember, this is a Jew in Jerusalem, 600 BC. Remember, too, that this 
  "translation" is supposed to be divinely inspired.)
  <P>What word could Nephi have been using in "Reformed Egyptian" that God would 
  inspire Joseph Smith to translate as "church"? The word "church" is never used 
  in the Old Testament, not even in the King James Version. In fact, there was 
  no such thing as a "church" among the Jews in 600 B.C. When the Jews referred 
  to the religious community of Jews (which was really just the community of 
  Jews - there was no notion of "religion" or religious organization separate 
  from the idea of the community), they used Hebrew terms which are translated 
  in the KJV Old Testament as "congregation" (over 300 occurrences): usually 
  translating the Hebrew words 'moed' ("meeting place, meeting"), 'edah' 
  ("appointed meeting, assembly, people"), or 'qahal' ("gathering, assembly").
  <P>Why would God not inspire Joseph Smith to use a word that would fit in with 
  the King James style that Smith was using already? Like "congregation"? The 
  word "church" occurs in the Bible (KJV) only in the New Testament, and, except 
  for two passages in Matthew (which many scholars consider to be later 
  interpolations), only <EM>after</EM> the death of Jesus and the rise of the 
  organization referred to since then as the "church." &nbsp; &nbsp; In the 
  English New Testament the word "church" is usually used to translate the Greek 
  word 'ekklesia,' which literally means "assembly" from the root meaning "call 
  forth." The term meant specifically the organization to which the followers of 
  Jesus belonged, to <EM>distinguish</EM> them from the Jewish "congregation."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 600 B.C. the organization of 
  the religious life of the Jews was simply the organization of the hereditary 
  priesthood, and either one was born a priest, or one was not. There was no 
  organization to "join." There was no "church."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This becomes even stranger when 
  Nephi begins to talk about the "two churches" of God and of the devil, in 1 
  Nephi 14, in the sense of distinctive religious groups with differing beliefs. 

  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then, in Mosiah 25:19-21, the 
  word "churches" is used as though for the first time. &nbsp; Notice that the 
  author feels he must explain what "churches" means. &nbsp; But didn't Nephi 
  already use the "Reformed Egyptian" term, and didn't the writer of Mosiah have 
  Nephi's writing available? 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>19 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma 
    that he might establish <B>churches</B> throughout all the land of 
    Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every 
    church.<BR>20 Now this was done because there were so many people that they 
    could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the 
    word of God in one assembly;<BR>21 Therefore they did assemble themselves 
    together in <B>different bodies, being called churches</B>; every church 
    having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word 
    according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.</I> [emphasis 
    added]</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, throughout 
  Mosiah and Alma, the word "church" is used (one or two centuries before 
  Jesus), even though it is really a New Testament word and a New Testament 
  concept. &nbsp; And it seems to be a new concept for that time, although Nephi 
  had written about "the church" in his records several centuries earlier.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Jews, meanwhile, in 
  Palestine, were meeting in "synagogues" for worship, prayer and teaching. And 
  "synagogues" are mentioned frequently in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> (25 
  occurrences). However, the word as used there is not used as a variant of 
  "church," but rather appears to mean something different - usually the place 
  of worship of a sincere but false religion. One of the first occurrences of 
  "synagogue" in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> is Alma 16:13: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the 
    people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their 
    synagogues, which were built after the manner of the 
  Jews."</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Now, this passage is extremely interesting, because the 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> does not indicate that there was any contact 
  between the descendants of Lehi and the Jews in Israel after about 590 B.C. 
  And yet scholars of Jewish religious history are almost unanimous in the view 
  that the synagogue, which we think of as so typical of Jewish religious life, 
  did not exist before the destruction of the temple and the Babylonian 
  Captivity (after 589 B.C.)! So how could any Nephite know about "synagogues 
  ... after the manner of the Jews"?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even the word "synagogue" is 
  Greek (from 'syn-' "together" and 'ag-' "bring, lead"), and, as mentioned 
  earlier, Greek influence was practically non-existent in Palestine until the 
  fourth century B.C., long after Lehi supposedly had left. The word "synagogue" 
  is used only once in the KJV Old Testament (Psalm 74:8) as a translation for 
  'moed.' So what is it doing in the Book of Mormon?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is it possible that Joseph Smith 
  (and his "divine" inspiration) couldn't translate these terms properly, thus 
  casting doubt on the divinity of the work? Or is it more likely that this is 
  just another indication that Joseph Smith was trying to produce another 
  "bible" on his own, without sufficient linguistic knowledge to get away with 
  it?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, Mormons will say that 
  these passages prove that there <EM>were</EM> synagogues and churches in 
  Jerusalem in 600 B.C.
  <P><A name=BIBLE>
  <H4>"Bible"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 2 Nephi 29:3-10, 
  Nephi (writing supposedly about 550 B.C.) prophesies that when the book he is 
  writing (the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>) comes forth, <I>"many of the 
  Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible..."</I>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word "Bible" is being used 
  here in the sense that it had in Joseph Smith's day: a collection of sacred 
  writings in a closed canon. &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word "Bible," of course, is 
  not found in the Bible itself. &nbsp; When the original Bible writers wanted 
  to refer to the sacred writings, the Hebrew writers in the Old Testament used 
  the Hebrew word 'k-th-b' "writing(s)." which included all kinds of writings, 
  both secular and sacred. &nbsp; The New Testament writers, writing in Greek, 
  used the word 'graphe,' which also means simply "[something] written" or even 
  "drawn, painted."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our English word "Bible" is an 
  anglicization of the Greek word 'biblia', which means "books," and is simply 
  the plural of the Greek word 'biblion' meaning "book." &nbsp; &nbsp; This word 
  (in its singular form only) appears about twenty times in the New Testament, 
  referring to a particular sacred book. &nbsp; But it never appears in the 
  plural (except once, and then it refers to pagan writings). &nbsp; The idea of 
  a Christian canon (list of approved books, a "Bible" in the traditional sense) 
  began only in the second century A.D., and the first such "canon" was put 
  together by Marcion about 150 A.D. (who is now considered by Christians to be 
  a heretic).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The King James Version of the 
  Bible uses the word "scriptures" only in the New Testament, where it is very 
  common. &nbsp; ("Scripture" in the singular, appears in the KJV Old Testament, 
  and only once, in Daniel 10:21.)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the time Lehi supposedly left 
  Jerusalem (600 B.C.) the idea of a closed canon of scripture (a "Bible") had 
  not developed. &nbsp; There was no such thing. &nbsp; If you study the history 
  of the development of the Jewish and Christian canon, you will find that the 
  idea of canonizing certain books (that is, stamping them with the seal of 
  divine authority) did not arise until the Alexandrian Jews, who no longer were 
  fluent in Hebrew, wanted to translate the Hebrew sacred writings into Greek 
  (about 250 B.C.), and thus a decision had to be made as to what books to 
  translate. &nbsp; The result, completed only after several generations, was 
  the Greek Septuagint (Old Testament), the first attempt to create a canon, a 
  "bible." &nbsp; &nbsp; The Jewish canon was not determined completely until 
  the first century A.D.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So the question arises with the 
  word "Bible" in 2 Nephi: what Hebrew (or "Reformed Egyptian") word appeared on 
  the golden plates, to be translated as "Bible"? &nbsp; The Book of Mormon uses 
  the word "scriptures" about 38 times. &nbsp; It is used in the way the New 
  Testament writers use it. &nbsp; "Bible" is a word, and - more important - a 
  concept which did not even exist until several centuries after it was 
  supposedly written by Nephi.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the Book of Mormon were 
  authentic and historically accurate, one would expect that when God told Nephi 
  that the Gentiles would cry, "A Bible! We have a Bible!" Nephi would have 
  asked, "Excuse me, God, what does 'Bible' mean? &nbsp; It's an idea I'm not 
  familiar with." &nbsp; &nbsp; And God would have given Nephi an explanation, 
  so that Nephite readers of his record would know what was meant: something 
  that would develop only many centuries later.

  <H4>More Greek Names</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you look 
  through the list of names in the pronunciation guide which the church includes 
  in every Book of Mormon, you will find other names in the Book of Mormon that 
  are Greek, and therefore anachronistic: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Antipas - name of a mountain in the BoM (Alma 47:7, 10); in the New 
    Testament, Herod Antipas was the son of Herod the Great, before whom Jesus 
    appeared (Luke 23:7-15) and who imprisoned John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-20). 
    Antipas is also the name of a Christan martyr, mentioned in Rev. 2:13. It is 
    a Greek name, an abbreviation for 'Antipater.' 
    <LI>Antipus - name of a general in the BoM (Alma 56); same as the previous. 
    <LI>Archeantus - Nephite commander (Moroni 9:2); a typical Greek formation, 
    made using the Greek prefix 'arch-' ("great, chief"), as in the Biblical 
    Greek names Archelaus and Archippus. 
    <LI>Ezias - (Hel 8:20) probably 'Esaias,' the Greek form of 'Isaiah." (see 
    <A href="http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#ISAIAH">above</A>) 
    <LI>Jonas - the name of two (!) of the twelve disciples selected by the 
    resurrected Jesus (3 Nephi 19:4); the Greek (i.e. New Testament) form of the 
    Hebrew name 'Jonah' 
    <LI>Judea - the name of a Nephite city (Alma 56, 57); it is the Greek (i.e., 
    New Testament) form of the Hebrew name 'Judah,' referring to the tribe, the 
    Southern Kingdom, and the area of southern Palestine occupied by the tribe 
    of Judah (the Jews). 
    <LI>Alpha and Omega - (3 Nephi 9:18) the Greek names for the first and last 
    letters of the Greek alphabet. In reference to God, these terms appear in 
    the Bible only in the Book of Revelation (probably second century A.D.) 
    <LI>Timothy - one of the twelve disciples selected by the resurrected Jesus 
    (3 Nephi 19:4); the name is pure Greek ('Timotheus') and means "honored of 
    God," and occurs frequently in the New Testament epistles (two epistles of 
    Paul are addressed to Timothy); the name does not occur, of course, in the 
    Old Testament 
    <LI>Zenos - supposedly a Hebrew prophet, mentioned several times in the BoM, 
    but unknown in the Old Testament; the name is Greek, either in the form 
    'Zeno' (the name of a Greek philosopher, 5th century B.C.) or 'Zenas,' in 
    the New Testament at Titus 3:13. 
    <LI>Angola - city name at Mormon 2:4 - Greek 'angelos', meaning "angel" 
  </LI></UL><A name=NAMES>
  <H4>More on <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> Names</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormons scholars have tried to analyze names in the <CITE>Book 
  of Mormon</CITE> to show that they show Egyptian characteristics, or that they 
  are actually Hebrew names which do not occur in the Bible, but only in 
  authentic texts discovered since Joseph Smith's day. &nbsp; Such evidence is 
  not convincing, since the similarities are often somewhat far-fetched, and can 
  be attributed to pure coincidence. &nbsp; In the case of Hebrew names, 
  especially, since Hebrew did not use vowels, and most Hebrew names consist of 
  no more than three or four consonants, it is not suprising that actual Hebrew 
  names would be similar to unusual names in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>. 
  &nbsp; The similarities are <EM>pure coincidence</EM>.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormons object to the critics' 
  calling such similarities "pure coincidence." &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet that is 
  precisely the argument Mormons use when presented with remarkable similarities 
  of <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> names to names which existed in the world of 
  the 19th century.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The names "Cumorah" (spelled in 
  the original 1830 edition of the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> as "Camorah") and 
  "Moroni" appeared on maps available in Joseph Smith's time, showing the 
  Camoros Islands with their capital city Moroni. &nbsp; A remarkable 
  coincidence!
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vernal Holley, in his study 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon Authorship: A Closer Look</CITE>, third edition, 1992, 
  (<A href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs2/2001vern.htm">online here</A>) 
  lists over a dozen names of geographical locations within a few hundred miles 
  of where Joseph Smith lived, in New York, Pennsylvania and nearby areas, which 
  closely resemble <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> names, the most obvious one, of 
  course, being the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, which is practically 
  identical to the name of the patriarch Lehi of the <CITE>Book of 
  Mormon</CITE>. &nbsp; There are quite a few such similar names:

  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not suggesting that the real 
  author of the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> actually used these modern place 
  names, or that he was even consciously aware of them. &nbsp; I list them 
  primarily to show that any similarities between <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> 
  names and Egyptian or Hebrew names unknown to Joseph Smith which may be cited 
  as "evidence of the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>" are rather meaningless. 
  &nbsp; It is interesting to note, however, that the city of "Teancum" is 
  described as "by the seashore" (Mormon 4:3), and the town of Tecumseh, a 
  suburb of Detroit, Michigan, is close to Lake Erie. &nbsp; Also, "Ripliancum" 
  is supposedly the name of a large body of water or "waters", and Ripley, 
  Maine, is within 40 miles of the cluster of large lakes in north-central 
  Maine, whereas Ripley, New York, is on the shore of Lake Erie.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is odd that the text of the 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> contains a number of words or names which the 
  author "translates" for us:
  <P><!---
	Irreantum (1 Ne 17:5)	"many waters"
	Rabbanah (Alma 18:13)	"powerful or great king"
	Rameumpton (Alma 31:21)	"the holy stand [pulpit]"
	Liahona (Alma 37:38)	"compass" (see below)
	Deseret (Ether 2:3)	"honey bee"
	Ripliancum (Ether 15:8)	"large, to exceed all"

  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if these were real "Reformed 
  Egyptian/Nephite" words with those meanings, why would Nephi be translating 
  them for us? &nbsp; It would be like my writing something like "And they came 
  unto Salt Lake, which, being interpreted, means 'Salt Lake'." 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Irreantum" is especially 
  problematical, because Nephi says that this is the name given by the Lehites 
  to the Indian Ocean. &nbsp; We must assume that the Lehite band were still 
  speaking relatively pure Hebrew, since they had left Jerusalem only a few 
  years before. &nbsp; But "irreantum" is not a Hebrew word, nor does it even 
  resemble a Hebrew word.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are at least four words 
  (other than proper names), however, which the author sees no need to 
  translate: "neas" and "sheum" (Mosiah 9:9, apparently edible plants), and 
  "cureloms and cumoms" (Ether 9:19, both "more useful" domestic animals than 
  horses and asses). &nbsp; One must wonder why these words were not 
  "interpreted" when they were mentioned. &nbsp; Incidentally, these items pose 
  real problems for Mormon apologists, since they are supposed to represent real 
  plants and real animals that were relatively abundant in ancient America. 
  &nbsp; And yet the fact that God's translator was unable to identify them with 
  any known species, either ancient or modern, necessarily raises the question 
  as to whether they actually existed except in the imagination of the author.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The opposite question occurs with 
  the names Bountiful and Desolation, each the name both of a "land" and of a 
  city. &nbsp; Surely these common English words are not the actual names by 
  which the Nephites referred to these cities and countries. &nbsp; But <EM>what 
  were their Nephite names?</EM> And why doesn't the author follow the same 
  pattern that was used before, with "Irreantum," for example? &nbsp; To put it 
  another way, if Joseph Smith was <EM>really</EM> translating, and the Nephite 
  word for "bountiful" occurred in the text, and he was inspired to translate it 
  into English, why didn't the same thing occur with all the other geographical 
  place names, which undoubtedly also had meanings?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be analogous to my 
  writing about events occurring in places in modern America for German-speaking 
  readers, and sometimes I would mention "Salt Lake City, which interpreted [in 
  German] means 'Salz-See-Stadt'", but then I would refer to "Ludwigstadt", 
  meaning St. Louis, and the Germans would wonder that there is a large city in 
  America with a German name, since I did not use its real name.
  <P><A name=ISABEL>
  <H4>Isabel the Harlot</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> mentions a harlot named Isabel (Alma 39:3). &nbsp; 
  "Isabel" is a name that only came into use in France and Italy during the late 
  Middle Ages. &nbsp; How could it occur in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> 
  during Alma's life? 
  <P><A name=KJV>
  <H4>More King James Mistranslations in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE></H4><A 
  name=VIRGIN>
  <H5>"virgin" - 2 Nephi 17:14 = Isaiah 7:14</H5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; The <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> preserves some demonstrable 
  mistranslations of the King James Version of the Bible. &nbsp; One notable 
  example is Isaiah 7:14, which in the KJV is translated "a virgin shall 
  conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel." &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This is copied word for word into the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> at 2 Nephi 
  17:14. &nbsp; The problem is that the Hebrew text has the word 'almah,' which 
  does <EM>not</EM> mean "virgin," but "young woman": the Hebrew word for 
  "virgin" is 'bethulah,' and most modern Bible translations do not use "virgin" 
  to translate Isaiah 7:14. &nbsp; (Some Christians, including the author of 
  Matthew 1:22-23, view this passage as a prophecy of the birth of Jesus from 
  the virgin Mary, but that ignores the entire context of that chapter: the 
  purpose of the prophecy was to answer King Ahaz' question about the outcome of 
  his upcoming war with Syria and Israel.) 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The error can be traced back to 
  the fact that the King James translators relied heavily on the Latin (Vulgate) 
  translation of the Bible by Jerome, from the 4th century A.D. &nbsp; Jerome, 
  in turn, relied on the Greek (Septuagint) translation of the Old Testament. 
  &nbsp; In Greek there is only one word for both meanings ("virgin" and "young 
  woman"), making the Greek translation from Hebrew ambiguous. &nbsp; But why 
  would Nephi be confused? &nbsp; He was (supposedly) in possession of the 
  original Hebrew text, which would have had the word 'almah,' not 'bethulah.' 
  But he mistranslates the passage just as Jerome and the King James translators 
  mistranslated it many centuries later.
  <P><A name=LUCIFER>
  <H5>"Lucifer" - 2 Nephi 24:12 = Isaiah 14:12</H5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Another remarkable example is at 2 Nephi 24:12, copied from 
  Isaiah 14:12, as translated in the KJV: <I>"How art thou fallen from heaven, O 
  Lucifer, son of the morning!"</I> Here again the problem is a reliance on 
  Jerome's Latin version (remember, from the 4th century A.D.!).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The only place the word "Lucifer" 
  occurs in the entire Bible is in the King James Version at this passage. 
  &nbsp; Other translations do not have "Lucifer" there (or anywhere at all), 
  but translate the word correctly as "day-star," "star of the morning" or 
  "morning star."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This passage, when read in 
  context, is addressed to the king of Babylon, who was very proud and haughty 
  and surrounded in worldly glory, but who was to be destroyed. &nbsp; "Lucifer" 
  is used in Jerome's Latin (and, following Jerome, in the King James Version) 
  to translate the Hebrew word 'helel', which means "morning star" (i.e., the 
  planet Venus). &nbsp; The Hebrew root 'h-l-l' means "shine" or "boast," so it 
  is probably a taunting pun in the Hebrew Isaiah. &nbsp; There were two Greek 
  names for the planet, both similar: either 'heos-phoros' meaning 
  "dawn-bringer," or 'phos-phoros' meaning "light-bringer." &nbsp; &nbsp; In the 
  Septuagint (Greek) translation of this passage, probably made in the first or 
  second century B.C., they translated 'helel' with the Greek word 
  'heos-phoros.' When Jerome translated the Bible into Latin, he used the 
  Septuagint as his source and simply translated the Greek word for Venus into 
  the Latin name of that planet, which is an exact translation of the Greek 
  'phos-phoros': luci-fer, from the Latin roots 'luc-' "light" and 'fer-' 
  "bring, bear, carry."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was not until well into the 
  Christian era that the idea arose that "Lucifer" was a name, and that the 
  verse applied to Satan and not to the king of Babylon. &nbsp; It is probably 
  influenced by the (erroneous) assumption that Luke 10:18 (saying that Satan 
  <EM>fell</EM> as lightning from heaven) is a reference to the Isaiah passage.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oddly, the only other place in 
  the Bible where the term "morning star" ('phosphoros') is used is at 2 Peter 
  1:19, where it refers to Jesus! 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Revelations 2:28 and 22:16 also 
  refer to the "morning star," meaning Jesus, but use a different Greek phrase 
  made up of the Greek words for "morning" and "star." &nbsp; &nbsp; One verse 
  promises the "morning star" as a reward to the faithful; the latter verse is 
  Jesus' saying "I Jesus ... am the root and offspring of David, and the 
  <EM>bright and morning star</EM>."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This error is compounded in 
  modern Mormon theology, with Lucifer as the name of a character in the 
  endowment ceremony. &nbsp; See also D&amp;C 76:25-27:
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God 
    who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only 
    Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, 
    was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, 26 And was called 
    Perdition, for the heavens wept over him--he was Lucifer, a son of the 
    morning. 27 And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of 
    the morning!" </I></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Error 
  upon error! A Latin word in the (Hebrew-"reformed Egyptian") Book of Mormon! 
  &nbsp; Now, if a Mormon should object that "Lucifer" is just a 
  <EM>translation</EM>, then we must ask: What is the Hebrew (or "reformed 
  Egyptian") word which it is translating? &nbsp; And how did it come to be the 
  name of the devil?
  <P><A name=FAMILIAR>
  <H5>"Familiar spirit"</H5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormons 
  believe that Isaiah prophesied the coming forth of the Book of Mormon (Isaiah 
  29:4): 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>And thou shalt be brought down, [and] shalt speak out of the 
    ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, 
    as of one that hath a <B>familiar spirit, out of the ground</B>, and thy 
    speech shall whisper out of the dust.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> itself echos this 
  prophecy, but more specifically (2 Nephi 26:14-17): 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>14 But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days; 
    concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things forth unto 
    the children of men.<BR>15 After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall 
    have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, 
    after the Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall 
    have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them; 
    and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they 
    are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the prayers of 
    the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief 
    shall not be forgotten.<BR>16 For those who shall be destroyed shall speak 
    unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, 
    and their voice shall be as one that hath a <B>familiar spirit</B>; for the 
    Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even 
    as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the 
    dust.<BR>17 For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which 
    shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, 
    and those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them, for they seek 
    to destroy the things of God. </I>[emphasis added]</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormons seem unaware that the word used in Isaiah 
  for "familiar spirit" is Hebrew 'ob,' occurring about fifteen times in the 
  Bible. It does <EM>not</EM> mean "a spirit which sounds familiar to you 
  (because it is written in the style of the King James Bible)," as most Mormons 
  think, but it means the spirit of a dead person, that is, a ghost, summoned by 
  necromancy, which is everywhere condemned in the Bible as abominable (e.g. 
  Leviticus 20:17, Deuteronomy 18:10-12, 1 Chronicles 10:13, 2 Chronicles 33:6, 
  Isaiah 19:3).
  <P><A name=STEEL>
  <H5>"Steel"</H5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another error 
  influenced by mistranslations in the King James Version is the mention of 
  "steel" and "iron." &nbsp; &nbsp; Others have pointed out that no evidence of 
  iron-working or steel has been found in pre-Columbian America. &nbsp; But 
  "steel" did not exist even in the Old World at the time Lehi supposedly left 
  Jerusalem. &nbsp; Where the KJV mentions "steel" (three passages: one in a 
  Psalm of David, one in Job, and one in Jeremiah) the original Hebrew text has 
  either 'nechushah' or 'nechosheth,' both of which mean simply "copper" or 
  "brass." &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus it appears that the author of the Book of Mormon 
  believed that "steel" such as was common in the 19th century, was also known 
  in Nephi's day.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem becomes more serious 
  for the Book of Mormon, however, since it also uses the term in attributing 
  the knowledge of steel-making to the Jaredites (Ether 7:9), just a few 
  generations after they are supposed to have left the Old World at the time of 
  the Tower of Babel (ca. 2200 B.C.?). &nbsp; Notice that the mention of steel 
  does not imply that it is anything newly invented or previously unknown, but 
  rather quite familiar.
  <P><A name=COMPASS>
  <H4>"Compass"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think the most 
  telling anachronism in the Book of Mormon involves the Liahona, the miraculous 
  "ball" or "director" which God gave Lehi to guide him in his travels (1 Nephi 
  16:10). &nbsp; Even if one grants, for the sake of argument, that God's power 
  includes the ability to give someone a magic ball like the Liahona, there is 
  still an anachronistic problem. &nbsp; In fact, it is what one might call a 
  <EM>double anachronism</EM>. Notice that in Alma 37:38, Alma is quoted as 
  saying (supposedly speaking about 73 B.C.): 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>"And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing 
    which our fathers call a ball, or director--or our fathers called it 
    Liahona, which is, being interpreted, <B>a compass</B>; and the Lord 
    prepared it." </I>[emphasis added]</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Alma also uses the word "compass" in verses 43 and 44. &nbsp; 
  Nephi also referred to the Liahona as a "compass" at 1 Ne 18:12, 18:21 
  (supposedly around 590 B.C.), and 2 Ne 5:12 (a few years later).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The passage in Alma is clearly an 
  attempt to explain one (unfamiliar) thing by saying it is like something else, 
  something familiar. &nbsp; Since the Book of Mormon claims to be a translation 
  from Reformed Egyptian (or Nephite?), the English word "compass" must be a 
  translation - divinely inspired, therefore correct! - for some Reformed 
  Egyptian (or Nephite?) word that means what "compass" meant in 1830 American 
  English in such a context, namely, a magnetic instrument used to determine 
  geographical direction.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, go to your encyclopedia and 
  read the article on the history of the compass. &nbsp; You will find that 
  there was no such thing, not even the idea of any such thing, until about 1100 
  AD in China, about 1187 AD in Europe, about 1220 AD in Arabia, and about 1330 
  AD in Scandinavia.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How could a word exist (the 
  Nephite word translated as "compass") when no such device existed (other than 
  the Liahona, of course), or would exist for another 1800 years? &nbsp; (The 
  word "compass" is frequently used in the English Bible translations, of 
  course, but never in the meaning of a direction device, only in the quite 
  unrelated meaning of "limit, circle, boundary, etc.") 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It would be analagous to the 
  passage in Washington's fraudulent journal, where he looks into the future in 
  America, and says: "There will come a time when every man will possess a 
  wonderful device somewhat like a typewriter, yet it will have a picture before 
  it, and the words typed by the typewriter will appear in the picture, and can 
  be sent around the world..." &nbsp; &nbsp; How could Washington explain what a 
  computer is by comparing it to a typewriter, when there was no such thing as a 
  typewriter in his day, and therefore the word "typewriter" did not exist?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of course the Mormon will 
  argue the Nephites also had compasses, but they all rotted or rusted away, 
  like the chariots and the steel swords.
  <P><A name=WINDOWS>
  <H4>"Windows"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another 
  anachronistic word in the Jaredite story, easily overlooked, is at Ether 
  2:22-23, where the brother of Jared is talking with God and reporting to him 
  that he has constructed the vessels for the trans-oceanic voyage to America. 
  &nbsp; The brother of Jared is truly smarter than God himself, since he has 
  noticed something that God had overlooked, and God must ask for advice: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>22 And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I 
    have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels 
    for my people, and behold there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt 
    thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?<BR>23 And the 
    Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye 
    may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have <B>windows</B>, 
    for they will be <B>dashed in pieces</B>.... </I>[emphasis 
  added]</BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What kind of 
  windows would be "dashed in pieces" by ocean waves? &nbsp; A porthole, opened 
  for light, cannot be dashed in pieces. &nbsp; Only a window covered with some 
  translucent material such as glass would run this danger. &nbsp; Nowadays we 
  think it only natural that windows for admitting light are provided with 
  glass. &nbsp; And in Joseph Smith's day, window glass was very common. &nbsp; 
  But at the time Jared's people were supposed to have lived, translucent 
  windows were still several thousand years in the future. &nbsp; Windows were 
  simply holes cut into the walls. &nbsp; <EM>There was no type of window in 
  ancient times that could be "dashed in pieces" by ocean waves!</EM> The Book 
  of Mormon is obviously talking about 19th century windows.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, windows are mentioned 
  frequently in the Bible. &nbsp; But they are not windows that could be "dashed 
  in pieces." &nbsp; &nbsp; They are mere openings. &nbsp; The only Bible 
  passage which might be thought to indicate that ancient windows had some 
  translucent material is Isaiah 54:12, God's promise to Israel captive in 
  Babylon, which in the KJV is translated: "I will make thy windows of agates." 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; No other modern translation has "windows" here. &nbsp; The 
  Revised Standard Version translates it "pinnacles," the Jerusalem Bible has 
  "battlements," Today's English Version has "towers," and the Contemporary 
  English Version has "fortresses," with a footnote that the Hebrew text is 
  "difficult" here. &nbsp; In other words, modern scholars do not agree with the 
  translators of the King James Version. &nbsp; Difficult or not, the <CITE>Book 
  of Mormon</CITE> reproduces the KJV translation, at 3 Nephi 22:12.
  <P><A name=BABEL>
  <H4>The "Tower of Babel"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  According to the Bible (Gen 11:1-9), at one time the "whole earth was of one 
  language, and of one speech." &nbsp; But because of men's pride, they began to 
  build a tower to reach to heaven, which made God angry, and he therefore 
  "confound[ed] the language of all the earth..." (v. 9)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These nine verses are a typical 
  "etiological" myth, i.e., a story invented to explain why something is so, 
  much like children's stories called "How the leopard got his spots," "Why the 
  sea is salty," "Why the sky is blue," etc. &nbsp; There are a number of other 
  etiological tales in the Bible, such as the tales to explain why a snake has 
  no legs (Gen. 3), or why we see a rainbow after a storm (Gen.9:13-16).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The point is: the Tower of Babel 
  story is just a story, a myth, an etiological fable. &nbsp; It no more 
  explains the origin of the many languages of the world than does the 
  punishment of Satan explain why snakes have no legs. &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as scientists can explain 
  the beautiful phenomenon of the rainbow by using the laws of optics (which 
  undoubtedly existed long before Noah's time), so linguistic scientists can 
  show that the many languages of mankind existed long before the period to 
  which the Tower of Babel can be assigned (Mormons believe the Jaredites made 
  their journey to America about 2200 B.C.). &nbsp; <EM>No reputable linguistic 
  scholar today accepts the Tower of Babel story as an explanation for the 
  multiplicity of languages, for their origins, or for the date of their 
  origins.</EM> The simple fact is that there are writings in many parts of the 
  ancient world (China, Mesopotamia, Egypt), in widely different languages, 
  dating from a thousand years before the supposed time of the Tower. &nbsp; 
  This uncontroverted fact shows that the Babel story is only a myth. &nbsp; 
  (See, for example, the article "Hamito-Semitic Languages" in <CITE>The 
  Encyclopedia Britannica</CITE>, 15th ed., Macr 8:592ff, which gives the dates 
  of the first appearance of those languages: Akkadian, 3200 BC; Canaanite, 
  Ugaritic, Amorite, 3000 BC.)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But it is not only the 
  <EM>languages</EM> of the all the world that supposedly originated at the 
  Tower of Babel, but also all the <EM>peoples</EM> of the world (Gen 11:8-9)! 
  In other words, in order to accept the story of the Tower as literal and 
  historical, one must believe that there were no other peoples on earth at the 
  time. &nbsp; Such a belief is contrary to everything that we know about the 
  early periods of human history.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Mormons should suggest that 
  the Tower of Babel must have been therefore much earlier than 2200 B.C., they 
  have the problem that Ether 1:6-33 lists the generations from Jared (who left 
  the Tower) to the last Jaredite, and there are only 28 generations. &nbsp; The 
  last surviving Jaredite (see Omni 1:21) was still alive some time after the 
  Mulekites' arrival in America about 600 B.C. &nbsp; To account for 28 
  generations between 2200 B.C. and ca. 600 B.C., the average generation would 
  already have to be 60 years apart. &nbsp; To make the "confusion of tongues" a 
  thousand years (or more!) earlier (to account for the Chinese, Egyptians and 
  Sumerians of ca. 4000 B.C.), every Jaredite father listed in the genealogy 
  would have had to be over 120 years old before fathering his oldest child.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Notice also that among the 
  "Jaredite" generations listed in Ether 1 are two <EM>Hebrew</EM> names, 
  "Aaron" (1:15-16) and "Levi" (1:20-21). &nbsp; And the name "Ephraim" occurs 
  at Ether 7:9. &nbsp; One must ask how such Hebrew names appeared in America, 
  when the Jaredites did not speak Hebrew, but rather a language which had not 
  been confounded.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most Christians (except for the 
  fundamentalist / evangelical inerrantists) can accept the mythical nature of 
  the Tower of Babel story. &nbsp; They can read it as allegory, an object 
  lesson about human pride. &nbsp; But Mormons must (and <EM>do</EM>) accept it 
  as literal and historical.

  <H4>More Mormon Mistranslations</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Joseph Smith was fond of translating individual words, especially Biblical 
  words, and giving them new meanings. &nbsp; He also gave new meanings to many 
  English words he found in the Bible. &nbsp; Few of those new definitions have 
  any linguistic validity.
  <P><B>"Sabaoth"</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Hebrew term occurs twice in the 
  KJV New Testament (Rom 9:29 and James 5:4) in the phrase "Lord of Sabaoth," 
  where the authors did not translate the Hebrew word, but merely wrote it in 
  Greek letters. This is probably why the KJV translaters also left it in its 
  original Hebrew form. &nbsp; The word occurs several hundred times in the 
  Hebrew Old Testament, where it is translated (correctly) as "hosts", in the 
  phrase "Lord of Hosts." &nbsp; The word is Hebrew 'saba' (sade - beth - aleph) 
  and means "host [military], warfare, service." &nbsp; The plural is made by 
  adding the ordinary Hebrew plural ending '-oth': 'saba-oth'.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, according to Joseph Smith, 
  D&amp;C 95:7, 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>...the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by interpretation, the 
    creator of the first day, the beginning and the 
  end.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><B>"Golgotha"</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This word occurs 
  three times in the Gospels (Matt 27:33, Mark 13:22, John 19:17), as the 
  Aramaic name of the place where Jesus was crucified. &nbsp; Each gospel 
  correctly gives its meaning in Aramaic for the Greek reader, as "place of a 
  skull," apparently because of the shape of the hill. &nbsp; Luke (23:33) calls 
  the place "Calvary," but this is the KJV translators' reliance on the Latin 
  Vulgate, rather than on the original Greek. &nbsp; In their original Greek 
  texts, all four gospel authors called the place by the Greek word 'kranion,' 
  meaning "skull" and all but Luke also then gave the Aramaic word which was its 
  local name, "Golgotha." &nbsp; 'Calvaria' is the Latin word for "skull" and of 
  course was thus also a (Latin) translation of "Golgotha."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, according to Joseph Smith, 
  in his "inspired" translation of Mark 13:22 (appearing in the JST at Mark 
  15:25), that is not what the word means: "...Golgotha, which is, (being 
  interpreted,) The place of a burial."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only is this a complete 
  mistranslation, but it makes no sense, since no one was buried at Golgotha.
  <P><B>"evangelists"</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sixth "Article of Faith" says 
  that Mormons believe in the "same organization that existed in the Primitive 
  [New Testament] church..." and lists various offices of the primitive church, 
  including "evangelists."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Evangelists" are mentioned only 
  three times in the New Testament. &nbsp; Philip was an evangelist in Caesarea 
  (Acts 21:8), but there is no hint as to why he was called that. &nbsp; 
  Evangelists are listed among other callings (prophets, teachers, pastors, 
  apostles) at Ephesians 4:11, without defining what an evangelist is. &nbsp; 
  But Paul hints at what an evangelist is in 2 Timothy 4:1-5, where it seems 
  clear that an evangelist is one who works at spreading the Gospel. &nbsp; 
  Since the Greek word for "gospel" is 'euangelion' and the verb meaning "to 
  preach the gospel" is 'euangelizein', clearly the Greek word for "evangelist" 
  (euangelistes) means "preacher of the gospel."
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, Joseph Smith declared: 
  "An Evangelist is a Patriarch, even the oldest man of the blood of Joseph or 
  of the seed of Abraham." &nbsp; (<CITE>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph 
  Smith</CITE>, p. 151) He goes on to say that the function of a "patriarch" in 
  the Mormon church is to give blessings. &nbsp; It is not primarily to preach 
  or to spread the gospel. &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are thus two problems with 
  the "evangelists" of the sixth "Article of Faith." &nbsp; First, Joseph Smith 
  gave a completely new meaning to the word, justified neither scripturally nor 
  linguistically. &nbsp; And second, there is no such title or office in the 
  Mormon church. &nbsp; (The Reorganized LDS Church, now renamed "Community of 
  Christ" at least calls their patriarchs "evangelists," but they are no more 
  correct linguistically than the Mormons.) 
  <P><B>"seal", "bind", "loose"</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormons use the word 
  "seal" and "sealing" to refer to the ritual by which they claim to bind 
  forever together in familial relationships husband with wife and parents with 
  children. &nbsp; This is one of the major purposes of the Mormon temple 
  ceremonies.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are many Biblical passages 
  with the word "seal," but they all refer to marking something with a seal, as 
  the ancient equivalent of a signature, to indicate its authenticity or its 
  completion (e.g Isa 8:16, Jer 32:10-11) or to close up a writing so that 
  unauthorized persons could not open it without revealing their intrusion (e.g 
  Isa 29:11, Dan 9:24, 12:4, 9). &nbsp; There is no biblical reference to 
  sealing by a priest as a religious ritual. &nbsp; The only religiously 
  significant sealing is done directly by God, and then it is in the sense of 
  marking or identifying or certifying something (Rom. 4:11, 2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 
  1:13, 4:30; Rev. 13:16-18). &nbsp; The Book of Mormon also uses "seal" in this 
  sense Mosiah 5:15 (by God) and Alma 34:35 (by the devil).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Mormonism, however, "seal" has 
  taken on this new and unprecedented meaning of "joining together permanently." 
  &nbsp; The <CITE>American Heritage Dictionary</CITE> acknowledges that the 
  Mormons have given this word a special (and otherwise unknown) meaning. &nbsp; 
  Under that verb, after listing its usual meanings (1. to affix a seal; 2. to 
  close up; 3. to certify; 4. to determine) an additional meaning: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>5. <U>Mormon Church</U>. To make binding for life; to 
    solemnize forever, as a marriage.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>This would seem to indicate 
  that Mormonism's use of the word is recognized as unusual. &nbsp; The meaning 
  is one invented by Joseph Smith and is not scriptural.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Mormons see the authorization 
  for their "sealing" to be the power that was given to Peter at Matt 16:19: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: 
    and whatsover thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and 
    whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in 
  heaven.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same 
  power is given later, at Matt 18:18, to all believers, without the reference 
  to "keys".
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word translated as "bind" in 
  Matt 16:19 is the Greek word 'deo', and it means to "tie up [like a 
  prisoner]," that is, to restrict someone's freedom, with a negative 
  connotation. &nbsp; It is used in that meaning about thirty times in the New 
  Testament. &nbsp; Paul uses it three times to refer to a person being bound by 
  the law to the spouse, (Rom 7:2, 1 Cor 7:27, 39), but even in those three 
  passages he is speaking of being restricted in contrast to being free. &nbsp; 
  A similar passage in John's gospel (20:23) hints at the correct intent of the 
  passages: the release from sin.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> 
  has the same passage as Matt 16:19, at Helaman 10:7, but changes "bind" to 
  "seal." &nbsp; Joseph Smith's "inspired" translation is identical to the King 
  James version of Matt 16:19.
  <P><B>"turn the heart of the fathers" (Malachi 4:6)</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This passage in Malachi, prophesying the return of Elijah, has played a key 
  role in Mormonism since Joseph Smith's 1823 visitation from the angel Moroni. 
  &nbsp; (See above, under <A 
  href="http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#ELIJAH">"Elijah and Elias"</A>.) In 
  the KJV, this verse reads: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, 
    and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the 
    earth with a curse.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This passage is the last verse in the Christian Old Testament.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> 
  has this same passage, as quoted by the resurrected Jesus to the Nephites, 
  with exactly the same wording as in the King James Version, at 3 Nephi 25:6.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smith's "inspired" translation of 
  the Bible ("JST") also contains the passage, exactly as in the KJV.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, in Smith's official 
  account of his 1823 vision of the angel, written in 1838, he reported that the 
  angel quoted to him several passages from Malachi, including this one, but, he 
  said (Joseph Smith - History 1:36-39, in the <CITE>Pearl of Great 
  Price</CITE>), 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>36. &nbsp; ... He [the angel] quoted also the fourth or last 
    chapter of the same prophecy [Malachi], though with a little variation from 
    the way it reads in our Bibles....<BR>39. &nbsp; He also quoted the next 
    verse [Malachi 4:6] differently: And he shall plant in the hearts of the 
    children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children 
    shall turn to their fathers. &nbsp; If it were not so, the whole earth would 
    be utterly wasted at his coming.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; It appears, then, that the angel was unaware of, or even 
  disagreed with, the words of Jesus as recorded in the gold plates which he was 
  planning to turn over to Smith, and the inspired text of the Bible.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But later even Smith disregarded 
  both the inspired words of Jesus and the angel: in a sermon he delivered 
  January 21, 1844, he said: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I>The Bible says, "...and he shall turn the hearts [sic] of the 
    fathers to the children, and the hearts [sic] of the children to their 
    fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." Now, the word "turn" 
    here should be translated "bind," or "seal." </I>(<CITE>History of the 
    Church</CITE> 6:183-184, also in <CITE>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph 
    Smith</CITE> 330) </BLOCKQUOTE><B>"the Sun [or Son?] of righteousness" 
  (Malachi 4:2 vs. 3 Nephi 25:2)</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 25th chapter of 3 
  Nephi is identical to the King James translation of Malachi 4, with two 
  modifications, one very minor, and one that betrays the English origin of the 
  Book of Mormon. &nbsp; Where Malachi says "...ye shall... grow up as calves of 
  the stall" Nephi says "...ye shall... grow up as calves <I>in</I> the stall." 
  &nbsp; That is insignificant.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the other change is where 
  Malachi says "the Sun of righteousness [shall arise]"; Nephi has "the 
  <I>Son</I> of righteousness." Although the two words 'sun' and 'son' sound 
  identical in English, Malachi was writing in Hebrew, and the Hebrew words for 
  'sun' and 'son' are quite dissimilar. &nbsp; Only in English could such a 
  confusion occur. &nbsp; Since the error makes a considerable difference in the 
  meaning, one must ask why God did not correct the error when the scribe was 
  writing the Prophet's dictation of this passage? &nbsp; (The JST translation 
  has "Sun".)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is interesting to note that an 
  article published in 1822 in Canandaigua, New York, (a few miles from where 
  Joseph Smith lived) makes the same mistake in discussing Malachi 4:2, quoting 
  it as "<I>Son</I> of Righteousness" (cited in David Persuitte, <CITE>Joseph 
  Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon</CITE> (second edition) p. 131).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, in his 
  <CITE>Mormon Doctrine</CITE>, article "Son of Righteousness" treats 'son' and 
  'sun' as having the same meaning. &nbsp; It appears that Mormon theology works 
  only in English.
  <P><B>"raiment" or "remnant"?</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; Isaiah 14:19 (KJV) says: "But 
  thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, [and as] the 
  <I>raiment</I> of those that are slain..." The Hebrew word translated as 
  "raiment" is 'lebush', which appears 28 times in the Bible, translated 
  variously in the KJV as "clothing," "apparel," "garment," "vestment," 
  "vesture," and, here, as "raiment." This passage also appears in the 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> at 2 Nephi 24:19, but "raiment" is replaced by 
  "remnant." Joseph Smith's "inspired" version of the Bible also has "remnant."
  <P>Which is correct? There are over eight Hebrew words meaning "remnant" in 
  the Bible, occurring dozens of times, none of them having the remotest 
  similarity to 'lebush.'
  <P>The explanation is quite obvious: Joseph Smith, in dictating the <CITE>Book 
  of Mormon</CITE> to his scribe, and reading from his King James Bible, said 
  "raiment" correctly, but the scribe mis-heard "remnant." And Joseph never 
  caught the error. "Remnant" doesn't even make sense in the context.
  <P><A name=BOA>
  <H3>The <CITE>Book of Abraham</CITE></H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; The <CITE>Book of Abraham</CITE> ("BoA") is Joseph Smith's translation 
  of some Egyptian papyrus scrolls that came into his possession in 1835. &nbsp; 
  He stated that one of the scrolls was written by the biblical Abraham "by his 
  own hand." &nbsp; Smith's translation is now accepted as scripture by the LDS 
  church, as part of its <CITE>Pearl of Great Price</CITE>. &nbsp; Smith also 
  produced an "Egyptian Grammar" based on his translation.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Modern scholars of ancient 
  Egyptian have also translated the scrolls, and they agree unanimously that the 
  scrolls, which are now in the possession of the Mormon church, are genuine, 
  but they are common Egyptian funeral scrolls, entirely pagan in nature, having 
  nothing to do with Abraham, and from a period 2000 years later than Abraham. 
  &nbsp; The "Grammar" has been said by Egyptologists to prove that Smith had no 
  notion of the Egyptian language. &nbsp; It is <I>pure fantasy</I>: he made it 
  up. &nbsp; (For details, see the links <A 
  href="http://packham.n4m.org/tract.htm#ABRAHAM">here</A>.)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But even if we did not have the 
  actual papyrus and the testimony of the Egyptologists, proving that it is a 
  hoax, we could recognize the <CITE>Book of Abraham</CITE> as such because of 
  the linguistic anachronisms in the text of Smith's "translation." &nbsp; In 
  considering the material below, remember that Abraham supposedly lived 
  somewhere between 2100 and 1700 B.C., according to most Bible chronologists.
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE><I><SMALL>I found the following linguistic anachronisms by my 
    own careful reading of the text of the BoA and by researching the words in 
    standard reference works. &nbsp; After I had completed my research I 
    discovered that Stephen E. Thompson had already covered the same ground in 
    his article "Egyptology and the Book of Abraham" in <U>Dialogue: A Journal 
    of Mormon Thought</U>, 28:1:143, Spring 1995. &nbsp; I was gratified to see 
    that my conclusions were confirmed by Thompson, who is a professional 
    Egyptologist.</SMALL></I></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=PHARAOH>
  <H4>"Pharaoh"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The BoA uses the 
  word "Pharaoh" as the <EM>name</EM> of rulers of Egypt (Abr 1:6, 20, 26) and 
  says that the meaning of the word (1:20) is "king by royal blood." &nbsp; The 
  first ruler named "Pharaoh" is identified as a great-grandson of Noah (Abr 
  1:25).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The linguistic problem is that 
  the word "pharaoh" originally meant "great house." &nbsp; It did not become a 
  title for the king until the beginning of the New Kingdom (18th Dynasty), 
  which began about 1567 B.C. &nbsp; That usage is unknown in Palestine until 
  after 1000 B.C. &nbsp; According to <CITE>Funk &amp; Wagnall's New Standard 
  Bible Dictionary</CITE>, article "Pharaoh": "It is certain that in Abraham's 
  time the kings of Egypt were not as yet called Pharaohs." &nbsp; At no time in 
  Egypt was the word used as the actual <EM>name</EM> of any king. &nbsp; Of 
  course, Genesis has the same anachronism (12:15), but no one has claimed that 
  Genesis was written by Abraham or a contemporary of Abraham.
  <P><A name=CHALDEA>
  <H4>"Chaldea"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abraham, according 
  to the BoA, lived in the "land of the Chaldeans" (1:1) which was governed by 
  Pharaoh (1:8-20). &nbsp; A place of sacrifice there had an Egyptian name, 
  "Potiphar's Hill" (1:20).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are multiple anachronisms 
  here.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Chaldeans" do not appear in 
  history until the 12th century B.C., quite a few centuries after Abraham 
  lived. &nbsp; The earliest mention of them in historical records is in the 9th 
  century B.C., in Assyrian records. &nbsp; It was not until 721 B.C. that they 
  established themselves, by seizing the throne of Babylon, ultimately 
  establishing a Chaldean dynasty in Babylonia, which ruled from 625 to 539 B.C. 
  &nbsp; It is only <EM>after</EM> this that the term "Chaldea" or "land of the 
  Chaldees" came to be used for "Babylon".
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This anachronism also occurs in 
  Genesis (11:31), but, as noted above, no one has claimed that Genesis was 
  written by Abraham or a contemporary of Abraham.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no historical evidence 
  that Egypt controlled any part of Mesopotamia at any time when Abraham might 
  have lived. &nbsp; Thus, it is a gross error to claim that Egyptian sacrifices 
  were taking place in "Chaldea" at a sacrificial place with an Egyptian name.
  <P><A name=EGYPTUS>
  <H4>"Egyptus"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The BoA says that 
  "Egyptus" was the wife of Ham (the son of Noah) and the mother of Pharaoh who 
  established the first government of Egypt. (Abr 1:23). &nbsp; The name 
  "Egyptus" is obviously intended to be the source of the name of the country. 
  &nbsp; But here is the linguistic problem: the name "Egypt" is <EM>not</EM> 
  Egyptian, but Greek ('Aigyptos'), and thus was not used for the name of the 
  country until the Greeks had contact with it, long after Abraham's time.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Greek name is a corruption of 
  an Egyptian name for the capital city of Memphis, 'Hat-kaptah'. &nbsp; Perhaps 
  the real name of Ham's wife was Hat-kaptah? &nbsp; No, because Abr 1:23 says 
  that "Egypt" is a <EM>"Chaldean" </EM>word (see previous section on 
  "Chaldea"), and it means "forbidden".
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Hebrew word for Egypt and the 
  Egyptians is 'Mizraim,' which adds to the confusion, because the Bible says 
  that Mizraim was a <EM>son</EM> of Ham (Gen 10:6, 13) and the ancestor not of 
  the Egyptians, but of the Philistines.
  <P><A name=KOLOB>
  <H4>"Kolob" and "Kokaubeam"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  "Kokob" and "Kokaubeam" appear at Abr 3:13, and are interpreted respectively 
  as "star" and "stars". &nbsp; These are genuine Hebrew words. &nbsp; 
  "Shinehah" in the same passage, meaning "the sun" is probably based on the 
  Hebrew word for "year" ("shanah"). &nbsp; "Olea" for the moon is a word 
  invented by Smith. &nbsp; "Kolob" (Abr 3), which is supposed to be the "star" 
  nearest to the throne of God, is perhaps intended to be the Hebrew word 
  'keleb' ("dog") and may refer to the star Sirius, nicknamed the "Dog Star" 
  (<I>Alpha Canis Majoris</I>), the brightest star in the northern-hemisphere 
  sky.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do these Hebrew words provide 
  weighty evidence in defense of the <CITE>Book of Abraham</CITE>? &nbsp; 
  Hardly. &nbsp; At the time Smith was producing the <CITE>Book of 
  Abraham</CITE> he was also intently studying Hebrew with a private tutor. 
  &nbsp; 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, too, Joseph Smith was 
  perhaps trying to be too clever: Abraham lived at a time long before the 
  Hebrew language had even developed. &nbsp; According to the article 
  "Hamito-Semitic Languages" in <CITE>The Encyclopedia Britannica</CITE>, 15th 
  ed., Macr 8:592, Hebrew did not develop until the 13th century BC. &nbsp; 
  Thus, Abraham could not possibly have spoken Hebrew.
  <P><A name=ENGRAVED>
  <H3>Engraving On Metal Plates</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  According to Joseph Smith, he translated the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> from 
  an original text which was engraved on metal plates. In the text, the ancient 
  authors mentioned how precious the space was on the plates, and they gave as 
  their reason for writing in Egyptian (or "reformed" Egyptian) that this 
  language required less space than Hebrew, their native language. This claim 
  does not hold up under examination.
  <P>

  <H4>"Reformed Egyptian"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does it 
  make sense that writing in Hebrew would have required so much more space than 
  writing in some form of Egyptian?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the time of Lehi there were 
  three written forms of Egyptian: Hieroglyphic (stone &amp; papyrus, from ca 
  2700 BC), Hieratic (ink on papyrus, from 2700 BC), and Demotic (all media, 
  from 650 BC).
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is an example of a short 
  sentence written in hieroglyphic Egyptian: 
  <CENTER><IMG alt="Hieroglyphics for 'I have given bread'" vspace=5 
  src="http://mormonthink.com/backup/linguistic_files/hieroglyph.jpg"> </CENTER>The characters were pronounced 
  "au er-tana tau" and mean "I have given bread." 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Hebrew this could be written 
  in seven Hebrew characters, pronounced "nathati lechem" (reading right to 
  left): 
  <CENTER><IMG alt="Hebrew characters for NTTI LHM" 
  src="http://mormonthink.com/backup/linguistic_files/bread-h.gif"> </CENTER>
  <P>If one were to use Hebrew characters to write the Egyptian sounds, the 
  Hebrew characters would be (also reading right to left): 
  <CENTER><IMG alt="Hebrew characters for 'W 'RTN TW" 
  src="http://mormonthink.com/backup/linguistic_files/bread-d.gif"> </CENTER>pronounced "au er-tana tau." 
  Clearly, hieroglyphic Egyptian would not have saved space on the metal plates.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hieratic Egyptian is derived 
  directly from the hieroglyphic, and is no more space-saving. But what about 
  demotic? It is essentially an alphabet, like Hebrew, with each character 
  representing a sound. Here is the demotic alphabet: 
  <CENTER><IMG vspace=5 src="http://mormonthink.com/backup/linguistic_files/demotic.gif"> </CENTER>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here is the Hebrew alphabet, 
  for comparison: 
  <CENTER><IMG vspace=5 src="http://mormonthink.com/backup/linguistic_files/hebrew.jpg"> </CENTER>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For comparison, here is the only 
  sample of characters from the plates that exists, the so-called "Anthon 
  Transcript," which Martin Harris took to New York to show to language 
  professors at Columbia.

    <P></SMALL></P></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One must 
  ask then, why would any Hebrew writer engraving onto metal tablets feel that 
  he would save a great deal of space by using demotic characters rather than 
  Hebrew? It would seem there would be no saving of space at all. Also, the fact 
  that the Jews considered their language sacred, there would be no reason 
  whatsoever for them to keep sacred records in a foreign language, especially 
  the language of a people who had oppressed and enslaved them. 
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some Mormon apologists have 
  pointed out that archaeologists have indeed found Egyptian writings in ancient 
  Palestine, and even some sacred Jewish texts written in Egyptian. Those can be 
  easily explained: Egyptians often occupied Palestine, so it would not be 
  unusual to find Egyptian writing there. There is no reason to assume that 
  Egyptian writings in Palestine were written by Jews and not Egyptians. At most 
  they would be written by bilingual Jews for Egyptian readers who did not know 
  Hebrew. That certainly would not be the case for Lehi's followers to write in 
  Egyptian. They had no audience whose only language was Egyptian.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A modern example might be the 
  fact that during the German occupation of France in the 1940s there were 
  obviously a number of publications in German, for use of the occupation 
  forces. Some Frenchmen were probably bilingual, and made translations of 
  French materials into German for German readers. But it would be extremely 
  unlikely that French speakers who escaped their occupied homeland and found 
  refuge in other countries would have written their diaries in German. And the 
  Jews with Lehi would just as unlikely have written their records in Egyptian.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why then, did the Nephites choose 
  to write in a form of Egyptian? &nbsp; The obvious answer seems to be that 
  Joseph Smith felt he was less likely to be exposed if he showed plates with 
  engravings in a still-undeciphered language (Egyptian) than in a relatively 
  better-known language (Hebrew). &nbsp; To add an additional degree of safety, 
  he claimed that the Egyptian had been "altered." &nbsp; &nbsp; His Egyptian 
  ploy finally caught up with him in the <A

  <H4>Editing "on the fly"</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One 
  must imagine the Nephite authors working with a stylus on their metal plates, 
  painstakingly etching each character. Surely they must have planned carefully 
  what they were going to write, before putting stylus to metal. But there are 
  numerous passages in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> which look like they are 
  the product of rapid dictation, with corrections made "on the fly." They seem 
  quite unlike the product of "think before you write." A few of the many 
  examples:

  <H4>Wordiness</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another

  <H4>Unnecessary repetition</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Another characteristic of the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> text is the frequent 
  unnessary repetition, again arousing suspicion that the original text was not 
  being engraved on metal in such a way as to conserve space. How often does 
  Nephi have to remind the reader of his identity by repeating "I, Nephi..." (84 
  times in 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi)?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here are more examples of 
  unnecessary repetition (see also the "tight like unto a dish" passage above):

  examples of on-the-fly editing, wordiness, and unecessary repetition could be 
  multiplied a hundredfold. Open any page of the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> and 
  you will find them. They are completely inconsistent with the claim that the 
  original text was engraved by the authors on metal plates. But they are quite 
  consistent with a conclusion that the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> is a text 
  which got its final form while being dictated, and that the author(s), rather 
  than trying to conserve precious space, was trying to expand the volume of the 
  text. Larger, longer books are more impressive, and can demand a higher price

  <H3>Linguistic Criticisms Which are Not Valid, or Quite Weak</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However much we might appreciate criticism of 
  Mormonism, there are a few linguistic objections - mostly to the <CITE>Book of 
  Mormon</CITE> - which are not valid or not convincing. At the risk of being 
  accused of defending Mormonism, I will point them out.
  <P>
  <H4>Reformed Egyptian</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some 
  critics have objected that there is no such known language as "Reformed 
  Egyptian." This objection fails on two counts. First, just because an ancient 
  language is not yet known, one should not assume that it does not exist. 
  Previously unknown languages are frequently discovered. Second, there is no 
  reason to suppose that an ancient, isolated people such as the Lehites, using 
  Egyptian as their language, would not modify it over the course of centuries. 
  That is a very common phenomenon. Modern English, for example, might 
  justifiably be called "Reformed Anglo-Saxon," or modern Italian might well be 
  referred to as "Reformed Latin."
  <P>
  <H4>"And it came to pass..."</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One 
  of the most frequent criticisms of the language of the <CITE>Book of 
  Mormon</CITE> is the frequent use of the phrase "And it came to pass..." That 
  may well be a valid criticism of the literary style of the supposed 
  translation, but that criticism overlooks the fact that the very same phrase 
  occurs quite frequently in the King James translation of the Bible, over 500 
  times in the Hebrew Old Testament and over 70 times in the Greek New 
  Testament. The phrase in the New Testament is a translation of the one Greek 
  word 'egeneto' meaning "it happened." In the Old Testament it translates a 
  word of four characters, pronounced 'weyehi' meaning "and it happened." It is 
  not unreasonable to assume that "Reformed Egyptian" might also have had such a 
  single short word.
  <P>
  <H4>"adieu" (Jacob 7:27)</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 
  fact that a French word is used in an English translation does not mean that 
  the original text had that same French word. "Adieu" is used in English in a 
  special sense, a final farewell to one whom one does not expect to see ever 
  again. If there were a word with such a specific meaning in an original text, 
  it would be quite appropriate to translate it into English with the French 
  word, since English has no word which is an exact equivalent.
  <P>
  <H4>" the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveler can return" <SMALL>(2 
  Nephi 1:14)</SMALL></H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Critics 
  object that this is a quotation from Shakespeare's Hamlet, from the famous 
  soliloquy beginning "To be, or not to be..." The line there is: <I>"the 
  undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns.</I>" 
  <SMALL>(Hamlet III:1) </SMALL>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The metaphor, however, is not 
  unique with Shakespeare. It occurs also in the Bible: <I>"I go whence I shall 
  not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death"</I>

  <H3>Linguistic Arguments in Favor of Mormon Claims</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormon apologists also use linguistic evidence in support 
  of Mormon claims. &nbsp; The supposed similarity of <CITE>Book of 
  Mormon</CITE> names to genuine Egyptian or Hebrew names has already been 
  discussed <A href="http://packham.n4m.org/linguist.htm#NAMES">above</A>. The 
  most important of the other claims will be discussed here.
  <P><A name=WORDPRINT>
  <H4>Wordprint Studies</H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some 
  Mormon apologists claim that wordprint studies confirm one claim of the 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>, namely that it is the work of multiple authors 
  (Nephi, Jacob, Alma, etc.). &nbsp; "Wordprint" refers to a statistical 
  analysis (usually done by computer) of different texts to discover supposedly 
  subconcious stylistic peculiarities of the author(s), such as preference for 
  particular phrases or words. &nbsp; (See for example the official Mormon 
  publication <CITE>Ensign</CITE>, January 2000, "Mounting Evidences for the 
  Book of Mormon".)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The techniques used in wordprint 
  studies are still subject to much debate (not just among those studying Mormon 
  writings) and the basic premises are questioned. &nbsp; Even one prominent 
  Mormon apologist, John Tvedtnes, has rejected such evidence for the <CITE>Book 
  of Mormon</CITE> (see <CITE>Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought</CITE>, 
  33:1:85-87). &nbsp; For other criticism of these studies, see Issue #84 of the

  <P><A name=CHIASMUS>
  <H4>Chiasm in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE></H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormon apologists have made much of the discovery of chiasms in 
  the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>. &nbsp; A chiasm (also called "chiasmus"), 
  named after the Greek letter 'chi' which resembles the letter 'X', is a 
  literary device where a series of statements or phrases is followed by a 
  reversed restatement of the same phrases: A, B, C, D, d, c, b, a.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This literary device was 
  discovered in the Bible in the 19th century, and Mormon apologists discovered 
  it then also in the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>. &nbsp; They present this as 
  evidence that the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> is divinely inspired, since 
  chiasm had not yet been recognized in the Bible when Joseph Smith produced the 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chiasm loses all of its 
  persuasiveness as evidence for the divinity of the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> 
  when one realizes that it is a literary device which can occur quite naturally 
  in non-divine writings as well, and that an author need not be consciously 
  aware of the device, nor know its name, to make literary use of it. &nbsp; 
  Joseph Smith's diary, for example, does not claim to be divinely inspired nor 
  to be an ancient document, yet the entry for April 1, 1834, is an excellent 
  example of chiasm: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>A  the Lord shall destroy him
   B  who has lifted his heel against me even that wicked man Docter P. H[u]rlbut
       C  he [will] deliver him to the fowls of heaven

       c  his bones shall be cast to the blast of the wind
   b  [for] he lifted his [arm] against the Almity
a  therefore the Lord shall destroy him
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third president of the 
  church, John Taylor, used chiasm quite naturally, and no Mormon claims that 
  the chiasm in his reflections are either evidence of divine inspiration or of 
  ancient origin: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>A  And He in His own person
   B  bore the sins of all,
      C  and atoned for them

               F  of ages
               f  and generations,
            e  the indescribable agony consequent upon

  Evidence for Ancient Authorship in 'Green Eggs and Ham'" demonstrated that the 
  same arguments which Mormon apologists use to show that chiasm is evidence for 
  the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> can also show that Dr. Seuss' children's book 
  "Green Eggs and Ham" is also ancient:

  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vernal Holley, in his book 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon Authorship: A Closer Look,</CITE> 3rd ed., p 26, (on line 
  <A href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/vern/vernP0.htm" target=new>here</A>) 
  points out that Solomon Spaulding's "Manuscript Story" (also called 
  "Manuscript Found"), considered by many - including Holley - to be a major 
  source of Joseph Smith's Book of Mormon, <EM>also</EM> contains quite a few 
  examples of chiasmus. &nbsp; And yet no Mormon apologist would consider that 
  fact as evidence that Spaulding's story is actually Hebrew scripture.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a thorough discussion of how 
  frequent (and natural) chiasmus is, see Dr. Mardy Grothe's website at <A 
  href="http://www.drmardy.com/chiasmus/welcome.shtml" 
  target=new>http://www.drmardy.com/chiasmus/welcome.shtml</A>. He gives no 
  indication that chiasmus is evidence of antiquity or of divinity (nor does he 
  mention the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE>).

  <P><A name=VOCABULARY>
  <H3>Claims of Similar Vocabulary - Semitic and Native American</H3>&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some Mormon apologists point to comments by 
  Dr. Roger William Westcott, linguistics professor at Drew University, and Dr. 
  Mary Ritchie Key, who have written on the similarities between many words in 
  Native American languages and the languages of the Bible lands. &nbsp; 
  Westcott and Key, however, did not base their comments on their own research, 
  but rather on research by Mormon Brian Stubbs. &nbsp; Stubbs simply scoured 
  vocabularies to compile his listing. &nbsp; However, similarities of 
  vocabulary (as any real comparative linguist should know) are not enough to 
  establish a connection between languages. &nbsp; There are far too many such 
  similarities that are pure coincidence. &nbsp; For example, Greek 'ho' means 
  "the" and Hebrew 'ha' means "the" Does that indicate that Greek and Hebrew are 
  related? &nbsp; Absolutely not. &nbsp; Aztec 'pax' means "war" and Latin 'pax' 
  means the opposite: "peace". &nbsp; Is that evidence that Aztec and Latin are 
  related? &nbsp; No. &nbsp; Greek 'theos' and Latin 'deus' both mean "god". 
  &nbsp; Striking similarity, but they are completely different roots, even 
  though Latin and Greek ARE related.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would guess that a careful 
  search of Chinese and English would turn up a list of words with similar 
  appearance and similar meaning. &nbsp; Would any linguist accept that as 
  evidence that Chinese and English are related, or that one is derived from the 
  other?
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormon apologists defend Stubbs' 
  work by pointing out that he also shows patterns of sound shifts, such as have 
  been observed in known language families such as the Indo-European group 
  (which includes most modern and ancient European languages), in addition to 
  the similarities in individual vocabulary items. &nbsp; However, Stubbs does 
  not present nearly the quantity of examples that support the Indo-European 
  sound shifts (the most widespread IE shift is known as "Grimm's Law").
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stubbs is Mormon and writing for 
  a Mormon audience. &nbsp; He has flummoxed two retired linguistic professors 
  (Key is now dead, actually). &nbsp; What about the thousands of other 
  reputable linguists who are not convinced? &nbsp; Only lay people are 
  convinced by vocabulary lists such as Stubbs'. &nbsp; (For many more such 
  vocabulary similarities, see <A href="http://tinyurl.com/52w8t8" 
  target=new>http://tinyurl.com/52w8t8</A>.)
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See also the article "Setting the 
  Record Straight About Native Languages: Linguistic Relationships" at <A 
  href="http://www.native-languages.org/iaq3.htm#4" 
  target=new>http://www.native-languages.org/iaq3.htm#4</A>.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For another example of an attempt 
  to use vocabulary similarities to support the <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> see 
  the article "Lehi in the Pacific" by L. Dwayne Samuelson <A 
  href="http://packham.n4m.org/pacific.htm" target=new>here</A> with my 
rebuttal.
  <P><A name=CONCLUSION>
  <H3>Conclusion</H3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In light of the 
  many linguistic blunders and erroneous translations made by this man who 
  claimed to be a divinely inspired "translator," it is difficult to see why 
  anyone with any understanding of linguistic phenomena would accept his claims. 
  &nbsp; Joseph Smith was quite ignorant of languages, in spite of his boasting 
  of his abilities and divine inspiration, and when one examines his linguistic 
  claims and his supposedly divine linguistic accomplishments, one must conclude 
  that if his god inspired him, his god was as poor a linguist as he was.
  <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mormonism's claims fail on many 
  other fronts besides linguistics. &nbsp; But even a few of the gross 
  linguistic errors as discussed here should be sufficient to show that Smith's 
  claims are no more than the boastings of an ignorant (although charismatic) 
  human being.
