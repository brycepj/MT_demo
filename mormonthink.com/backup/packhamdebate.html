    an invitation from the website <A href="http://publicsquare.net/" 
    target=new>Public Square</A>, which features online debates on a wide range 
    of topics - politics, society, philosophy, religion. The website wanted to 
    include a debate on some topic related to Mormonism, and asked me to submit 
    a first statement. As of this writing (July 16, 2010) the debate is being 
    prepared by both sides.]</I>

  <H3>DEBATE TOPIC: Is the Book of Mormon an authentic ancient history of 
  ancient American peoples, or a work of 19th century religious fiction?</H3>The 
  <CITE>Book of Mormon</CITE> (BoM) was first published in Palmyra, New York, in 
  1830, its title page giving the name Joseph Smith, Jun., as "Author and 
  Proprietor." Smith, then 24 years old, claimed that he had not composed the 
  text of the book, but that he had "translated" it from a set of golden plates 
  which he had dug out of a nearby hill under the direction of an angel. The 
  original text was inscribed on the plates in a hitherto unknown language 
  called "reformed Egyptian," but he was directed to translate it using special 
  spectacles accompanying the plates. He was told that if he looked through 
  these "interpreters" (which he later called "the Urim and Thummim") he would 
  receive divine help enabling him to read the text.
  <P>He was told by the angel that the text was an ancient record compiled and 
  preserved by many generations of the former inhabitants of the American 
  continent, and was a narrative of their history, their civilization, their 
  wars, and their religion, and that God had preserved this record to come forth 
  through Smith. God's alleged purpose in doing this was to tell Americans that 
  they were living in a place that was preserved for God-fearing peoples, and 
  that they would be punished if they did not live righteously.
  <P>Joseph Smith described the book (in the well-known "Wentworth Letter", at 
  <A href="http://is.gd/bVUxI" rel=nofollow target=new>http://is.gd/bVUxI</A>) 
  as being "the history of ancient America..., from its first settlement by a 
  colony that came from the Tower of Babel at the confusion of languages to the 
  beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era." The book says that 
  "...America in ancient times has been inhabited by two distinct races of 
  people. The first were called Jaredites and came directly from the Tower of 
  Babel. The second race came directly from the city of Jerusalem about six 
  hundred years before Christ. They were principally Israelites of the 
  descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the 
  Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the inheritance of the 
  country. The principal nation of the second race fell in battle towards the 
  close of the fourth century. The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this 
  country. This book also tells us that our Savior made His appearance upon this 
  continent after His Resurrection..."
  <P>This book has been accepted as holy scripture, along with the Bible, by 
  many people since 1830. Generally called "Mormons," they are divided into 
  dozens of sects, the largest of which is officially called "The Church of 
  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
  Almost all Mormons firmly assert that the BoM is indeed an ancient history of 
  pre-Columbian America, dating from about 2000 BCE to about 421 CE. (The 
  members of the second-largest Mormon group, the Community of Christ, seem 
  ambivalent about the historicity of the BoM, although they do consider it as 
  scripture.) 
  <P>Is that assertion correct? Is it reasonable? Is there any reason to doubt 
  it?
  <P>In the early 19th century it was believed by many that the American Indians 
  were indeed descended either from the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, or perhaps 
  from refugees from the Tower of Babel. There seemed no other explanation to 
  Bible-believers as to where the Indians had come from. An American clergyman, 
  Ethan Smith (no relation to Joseph) had published in the 1820s a treatise 
  called <CITE>A View Of The Hebrews</CITE> in which he propounded the Lost 
  Tribes theory, with extensive Bible citations to support it.
  <P>In the years since, much has been learned about the numerous civilizations 
  and cultures that existed in the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans. 
  We have their artifacts, we can trace their paths of settlement, we know much 
  of their histories, we can read the languages of those who had writing, we can 
  trace their origins through DNA studies, archaeology and anthropology to their 
  primary place of origin tens of thousands of years ago in eastern Asia.
  <P>Nothing that has been discovered by history, archaeology, anthropology, 
  zoology, linguistics, or any other branch of science resembles anything 
  described in the BoM. Nothing. In fact, most of what scientists have 
  discovered about pre-Columbian America directly contradicts what the BoM says.
  <P>The BoM implies that the immigrants from the Near East came to a land that 
  was empty and unknown to others. It describes a civilization (the Nephites) 
  which was basically Christian in religion. The Nephites had cattle, goats, 
  horses, and other domesticated animals. Their foods were wheat, barley, corn. 
  They had steel swords and chariots for their wars. Their currency was pieces 
  of gold and silver. Their precious ornaments were of gold, silver, and other 
  metals. They kept their records in a form of Egyptian. 
  <P>This Nephite civilization lasted for a thousand years, and yet no trace of 
  anything resembling this has been found anywhere in America. (For comparison 
  with a real ancient civilization, contemporary with the Nephites, for which 
  there is indeed abundant archaeological and other evidence, see <A 
  href="http://packham.n4m.org/romans.htm" target=new>"Romans and 
  Nephites"</A>.) 
  <P>Many Mormon scholars (primarily at Brigham Young University) now claim that 
  the BoM events took place in southern Mexico and central America. We know a 
  great deal about the ancient history of that area. Those peoples had no wheat 
  or barley, no domesticated animals (except dogs, turkeys, ducks and coatis, 
  none of which are mentioned in the BoM). The wheel was unknown. There were no 
  horses or cattle. Their foods were squash, peppers, maize (corn), beans, 
  cocoa, avocados, turkeys, manioc, tomatoes, amaranth and chia (none of which 
  are mentioned in the BoM, except corn). They did not have metal coinage, but 
  frequently used cocoa beans as currency. They made extensive use of obsidian, 
  jade, and feathers in the decorative arts, none of which are mentioned in the 
  BoM. Their language, both written and spoken, is completely unrelated to 
  Egyptian (or Hebrew). Their religion was pagan, with many gods, and included 
  human sacrifice.
  <P>Other Mormon scholars (primarily Rodney Meldrum and his colleagues at <A 
  href="http://www.bookofmormonevidence.org/" rel=nofollow 
  target=new>BookOfMormonEvidence.org</A> dispute the Mesoamerican theory and 
  place the early BoM events in the Great Lakes region, based primarily on the 
  statements of Mormon prophets.
  <P>The agriculture and technology of the civilization described in the BoM 
  resembles rather the technology of the early 19th century in America or 
  Europe, or what a writer of that more modern age might have imagined the 
  ancient Americas to have been like. In other words, the BoM is full of 
  anachronisms, any one of which would betray it as a 19th century work of 
  fiction. Anachronisms are the surest evidence of the falsity of a fraudulent 
  document that claims to be historical.
  <P>But there is more.
  <P>Real history does not include absurd "tall tales," those exaggerated events 
  that are intended to awe and impress the reader, but which are contrary to all 
  human experience. The BoM has quite a few of these unbelievable "tall tales." 
  The Book of Ether (chapters <A href="http://scriptures.lds.org/ether/2" 
  rel=nofollow target=new>2</A>, <A href="http://scriptures.lds.org/ether/6" 
  rel=nofollow target=new>6</A>) tells of a 344-day ocean crossing by a group of 
  people from the Tower of Babel in special boats which often traveled beneath 
  the surface (submarine-like), and which had only two openings for ventilation, 
  one on the top and one on the bottom (for when the waves overturned the 
  boats). The boats contained not only the human immigrants, but also their 
  cattle and other animals (fish, birds, bees), and, presumably, water and food 
  for all of them. (For a detailed critique of this account, click <A 
  href="http://packham.n4m.org/ships.htm" target=new>here</A>.)
  <P>The BoM describes the land as consisting of two areas, the "land northward" 
  and the "land southward," connected by a "narrow neck of land." Early Mormon 
  prophets said that this was a description of the two American continents, 
  connected by the Isthmus of Panama. Mormon proponents of the Mesoamerican 
  location tend to view the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the "narrow neck" (even 
  though it is about 150 miles across), whereas Meldrum's group identifies the 
  area between two of the Great Lakes as the "narrow neck." The BoM describes a 
  great famine, during which great numbers of cattle were pushed by snakes 
  ("serpents") into the "narrow neck" where so many died that people were unable 
  to pass from one land to the other.
  <P>The two great civilizations described in the BoM (the Jaredites, ca 2000 
  BCE - ca 200 BCE, and the Nephites, ca 590 BCE - 395 CE) are both completely 
  annihilated, with only one survivor. The Jaredites perished in a civil war, 
  two million warriors and their families. No one was able to escape except one 
  general, who, with the opposing general, were the last two survivors. One 
  general beheaded the other, who, headless, "gasped for breath" and died. 
  Nothing like such a battle, with only one survivor out of millions of 
  combatants, is known in real history.
  <P>The Nephites were also annihilated, but their destroyers (the "Lamanites") 
  survived to be known as the American Indians. Hundreds of thousands of 
  Nephites perished. Again, no such gigantic battle is known in real history.
  <P>And both of these great battles (amazingly!) occurred in the very same 
  place, according to the BoM. Incidentally, no archaeological evidence of such 
  massive battles has been found.
  <P>But there is more.
  <P>The Jaredites supposedly escaped from the destruction of the Tower of 
  Babel, due to the righteousness of one of their leaders. No modern linguist or 
  historian views the biblical story of the Tower as historical. 
  <P>The BoM explains that the dark skin of the American Indians is due to the 
  unrighteousness of their ancestors (the Lamanites), and that righteousness 
  will turn dark-skinned people white. No scientist accepts that as the cause of 
  darker skin or a way to lighten skin color. 
  <P>The BoM claims that Jews of the 6th century BCE kept their sacred records 
  in Egyptian, not Hebrew (<A href="http://scriptures.lds.org/mosiah/1#4" 
  rel=nofollow target=new>Mosiah 1:4</A>). Any scholar of Jewish history would 
  find that to be absurd.
  <P>The plates from which the BoM were allegedly translated contained many 
  passages from Hebrew scriptures, mostly Isaiah. They appear in the BoM in 
  almost identical wording to the King James Translation (KJV) of 1611. And they 
  include many of the same errors as were made by the KJV. Also, large portions 
  of the so-called Deutero-Isaiah are included, which Isaiah scholars date as 
  having been written only after the Babylonian Captivity, that is, AFTER Lehi 
  had left Jerusalem.
  <P>No non-Mormon historian, archaeologist, anthropologist, biologist, linguist 
  or other expert in ancient American matters considers the BoM to be at all an 
  accurate account of ancient American events or cultures. Not one.
  <P>Mormons themselves recognize the lack of evidence for its historicity, in 
  that they insist that the best way to know that the BoM is "true" is to pray 
  and ask God about it. And if you pray sincerely, "with faith in Jesus Christ," 
  and feel a "burning in the bosom," then you will know without further 
  evidence, that the BoM is what it claims to be: a sacred and secular history 
  of the two great cultures that inhabited America before Columbus.
  <P>We apply Occam's Razor to the question. Which of these two explanations of 
  the BoM is the simplest, and therefore the most likely?
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The BoM, in spite of all its anachronisms, tall tales, problems, 
    and lack of archaeological or scientific confirmation, is indeed an ancient 
    record, written on golden plates, preserved by an angel, delivered to a 
    young American who translated them with divine power by reading the 
    translation from a seer stone placed in his hat.
    <P>
    <CENTER>OR
    <P></CENTER>The BoM is a religious historical fiction, a product of the19th 
    century American frontier, reflecting the religious ideas of that time, the 
    theories about Indian origins of that period, but suffering from the 
    author's lack of accurate information about the real ancient history of the 
    Americas.
