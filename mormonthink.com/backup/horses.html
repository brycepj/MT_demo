the fact that schoolchildren in the United States have long been taught that the

rely on a different part of their brain in religious contexts than they do in 
other non-religious contexts.&nbsp; It just doesn’t “connect”.&nbsp; Moreover, 
this flaw did not “connect” with other nineteenth century authors, either.&nbsp;

warriors who annihilated General George Custer’s US Army battalion at the famous 
battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876.&nbsp; We easily forget that horses and 
rifles were originally unknown to Native Americans.&nbsp; They were brought by 
Europeans and proceeded to transform the societies of Indian tribes that 
acquired them.&nbsp; Thanks to their mastery of horses and rifles, the Plains 
Indians of North America, the Araucanian Indians of southern Chile, and the 
Pampas Indians of Argentina fought off invading whites longer than did any other 
Native Americans, succumbing only to massive army operations by white

and </SPAN></SPAN></B><FONT face=Arial><SPAN 
style="COLOR: black"><B>manatees.&nbsp; The combination of ungulates’ large, 
sturdy bones and teeth and their great abundance in most faunas leads to their 
having an excellent and relatively complete fossil record.&nbsp; The horse 
family, Equidae, is no exception to this generalization.&nbsp; Many tens of 
thousands of specimens of equid fossils have been discovered in North America, 
Eurasia, Africa, and to a lesser degree, South America.&nbsp; These range from

equid fossil record for well over 150 years, continually making new discoveries, 
describing new species, reinterpreting old data, and in general learning more 
about the evolution, anatomy, and ecology of this group.&nbsp; For example, 
paleontologists named an average of three new species of horses between 1973 and 
1987.&nbsp; Many paleontologic interpretations are controversial, with 
contending or alternative hypotheses and theories held by different 
specialists.&nbsp; As new specimens are found and more data accumulate, some of 
these ideas are proven unlikely, whereas others are corroborated or totally new 
hypotheses are proposed. By this method paleontologists progressively gain 
greater understanding of the evolutionary history of the horse, as well as other 
organisms.&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></P>

important role in the history of science, in particular the study of biologic 
evolution.&nbsp; In the late 1800s horses became the first group of mammals that 
paleontologists could place in a reasonably plausible sequence of ancestors and 
descendants from a living species back to the beginning of the Age of Mammals, 
65 million years ago.&nbsp; Although we now know this sequence was grossly 
oversimplified, incomplete, and in places simply wrong, it was still an 
important achievement for the time.&nbsp; With the wide availability of fossil 
specimens, most natural history museums had the resources to display an exhibit 
on the evolution of the horse and scores of biology and geology textbooks used 
the horse as an example for an evolutionary sequence.”</P></DIV></SPAN></FONT>

getting into details, which are murky to begin with, starting in the very late 
Pliocene, about 2.5 million years ago, most North American fossil faunas 
contained two to four species of Equus.&nbsp; Often there was a small, 
pony-sized type coexisting with a larger form, both with relatively stout 
limbs.&nbsp; An additional, very slender-legged, usually medium-sized species 
probably related to the Asiatic asses was occasionally present as well, 
especially in the early and middle Pleistocene.&nbsp; There are more Pleistocene 
fossil localities than from any other age, because this period is the most 
recent, and Equus is common in almost every locality that contains large 
mammals.&nbsp; This situation continued until near the end of the Pleistocene, 
about 11,000 years ago, when many North American mammals became extinct over a 
short period of time.&nbsp; Victims of this mass extinction event included 
mammoths, mastodons, ground sloths, camels, tapirs, and horses among the large 
herbivores as well as the large carnivores that preyed upon them, such as lions, 
saber-toothed cats, and dire wolves.&nbsp; There is an ongoing controversy as to 
the immediate cause of this event, with rapid climatic and ensuing vegetational 
change, and overhunting by humans being the two opposing views.&nbsp; In either 
case the 57-million –year history of the horse in North America came to an end, 
at least until the introduction of domesticated horses and donkeys by European 
explorers and colonists.&nbsp; </FONT></B>

name="Sorenson Claims"></A>While, at times, Book of Mormon scholars claim that 
the damp Mesoamerican climate and the acidic soil explain why there could have 
been horses who left no remains, (see “Horses in the Book of Mormon”, a FARMS 
report), this does not stop them from attempting to locate such evidence, 
nonetheless.&nbsp; John Sorenson offered a controversial reference for such 
remains, which was then analyzed in <U>The Quest for Gold Plates</U>, by Stan 
Larson, page 190:</FONT></B></P>

in an effort to support his position that the horse might have survived into 
Book of Mormon times, stated the following:</FONT></B>
<P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Pleistocene fauna could not have 
survived as late as 2000 BC.&nbsp; Dr. Ripley Bullen thought horses could have 
lasted until 3000 BC in Florida, and JJ Hester granted a possible 4000 BC 
survival date.&nbsp; </FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Let us examine Sorenson’s three 
assertions.&nbsp; (1)Paul S. Martin, professor of geosciences at the University 
of Arizona, was quoted out of context, for after expressing the theoretical 
possibility that Sorenson referred to,&nbsp; Martin then made the following 
strong statement:&nbsp; “But in the past two decades concordant stratigraphic, 
palynological [relating to the study of pollen], archaeological, and radiocarbon 
evidence to demonstrate beyond doubt the post-glacial survival of an extinct 
large mammal has been confined to extinct species of Bison.”&nbsp; (2)Ripley 
Bullen spoke in general of the extinction of mammals in Florida and not 
specifically of the horse as Sorenson asserted.&nbsp; (3)James J. Hester, 
professor of anthropology at the University of Colorado, did not suggest that 
the horse survived until 4000 BC, but rather used a date more than two thousand 
years earlier.&nbsp; Hester’s date of 8240 years before the present (with a 
variance of +- 960 years) was published in 1967, but the validity of the 
radiocarbon dating for these horse remains at whitewater Draw, Arizona, has been 
questioned.&nbsp; The next youngest horse of 10,370 +- 350 years ago has a 
better quality of material being dated and stronger association between the 
material actually being tested and the extinct genus.&nbsp; Clearly, Sorenson’s 
three arguments for a late survival of the horse do not hold up under 
scrutiny.&nbsp; Certain now extinct species may have survived in particular 
areas after the Ice Age.&nbsp; For example, one scholar recently stated that “in 
one locality in Alberta, Equus conversidens [a short-legged, small horse] may 
have been in existence about 8,000 BP (Before Present).&nbsp; While there may 
have been small “pockets” of horses surviving after the Late Pleistocene 
extinctions, the time period for such survivals would still be long before the 
earliest Jaredites of the Book of Mormon.&nbsp; </FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>John W. Welch, professor of law at 
BYU, referred to the find in Mayapan or horse remains which were “considered by 
the zoologist studying them to be pre-Columbian.”&nbsp; Examination of Welch’s 
citation reveals that he misinterpreted the evidence, which does not date to pre 
Columbian times (and hence potentially to the BoM period) but rather to 
prehistoric Pleistocene times.&nbsp; This find at Cenote Ch’en Mul consists of 
one complete horse tooth and fragments of three others, which were found six 
feet below the surface in black earth and were “heavily mineralized 
(fossilized), unlike any other material in the collections.”&nbsp; Thousands of 
bones and teeth were examined at Mayapan, which is a Late Post Classic site 
established in the thirteenth century AD, but these four horse teeth were the 
only ones fossilized.&nbsp; The reporting scholar did not suggest that the Mayan 
people hade ever seen&nbsp; a pre-Columbian horse, but that in Pleistocene times 
horses lived in Yucatan, and that “the tooth fragments reported here could have 
been transported in fossil condition by the Maya as curiosities.&nbsp; Thus, 
Welch’s assertion about pre-Columbian horses must be corrected to refer to 
ancient Pleistocene horses, since these fossilized horse teeth at Mayapan date 
to thousands of years before the Jaredites.” (p. 190-191)</P></DIV></FONT></B>

Mexico, on two previous occasions.&nbsp; Mercer (THE HILL CAVES OF YUCATAN, 
LIPPINCOTT, PHILA., 1896, p. 1972 and map opposite title page) found horse 
remains in three caves in the Serrania, a low range of limestone hills lying in 
southwestern Yucatan and trending roughly parallel to the southwest border of 
that state. The horse material was associated with pot sherds and other 
artifacts and showed no evidence of fossilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cope (in Mercer

teeth constitute a part of a large collection of vertebrate remains obtained by 
archaeologists of the Carnegie Institution of Washington during excavation at 
the Mayan ruins of Mayapan, Yucatan (20,38N,89,28W). &nbsp;This collection was 
submitted to the author for identification, and a checklist of the material is 
in preparation. The horse teeth were collected in cenote Ch’en Mul (Section Q, 
topographic map of the ruins of Mayapan, Jones, Carnegie Inst. Washington, Dept. 
Archaeology, Current Rept. 1, 1952) from the bottom stratum in a sequence of 
unconsolidated earth almost 2 meters in thickness. As in the deposits reported 
by Mercer and Hatt, pottery occurs throughout the stratigraphic section.&nbsp; 
The horse teeth are not specifically identifiable. They are considered to be 
pre-Columbian on the basis of depth of burial and degree of mineralization. Such 
mineralization was observed in no other bone or tooth in the collection although 
thousands were examined, some of which were found in close proximity to the

curios by the Mayans, but the more numerous horse remains reported by Hatt and 
Mercer (if truly pre-Columbian) could scarcely be explained in this manner.

use of caves by the ancient Maya has been previously documented, but the nature 
of artifact preservation in these caves presents unique problems not encountered 
in surface sites of the region. The absence of stratigraphy, though it means 
that we can view objects as they were left by the Maya, also means that 
perspective can be distorted, for actions that may have taken place over a long 
period of time result in an arrangement of objects that appears to us to be 
synchronic. The nature of artifact preservation in caves presents another, more 
pressing problem: artifacts are accessible and therefore easily stolen. Although 
all surface sites in Belize are endangered, cave sites are especially so, and in 
recent years theft of artifacts and attendant destruction of sites has 
increased. The following is a report of excavations in a cave that is one of 
many in an area that has begun to experience the destructive effects of looting 
within the last decade. We hope that this report will heighten the awareness of 
archaeologists of the significance of cave sites and stimulate interest in the

from the late 1950s reported results from excavations by scientists working on 
the Yucatan Peninsula. Excavations at the site of Mayapan, which dates to a few 
centuries before the Spaniards arrived, yielded horse bones in four spots. (Two 
of the lots were from the surface, however, and might represent Spanish horses.) 
From another site, the Cenote (water hole) Ch'en Mul, came other traces, this 
time from a firm archaeological context. In the bottom stratum in a sequence of 
levels of unconsolidated earth almost two meters in thickness, two horse teeth 
were found. They were partially mineralized, indicating that they were 
definitely ancient and could not have come from any Spanish animal. The 
interesting thing is that Maya pottery was also found in the stratified soil 
where the teeth were located.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-WEIGHT: 700">Subsequent digging has 
expanded the evidence for an association of humans with horses. But the full 
story actually goes back to 1895, when American paleontologist Henry C. Mercer 
went to Yucatan hoping to find remains of Ice Age man. He visited 29 caves in 
the hill area—the Puuc—of the peninsula and tried stratigraphic excavation in 10 
of them. But the results were confused, and he came away disillusioned. He did 
find horse bones in three caves (Actun Sayab, Actun Lara, and Chektalen). In 
terms of their visible characteristics, those bones should have been classified 
as from the Pleistocene American horse species, then called Equus occidentalis 
L. However, Mercer decided that since the remains were near the surface, they 
must actually be from the modern horse, Equus equus, that the Spaniards had 
brought with them to the New World, and so he reported them as such.<A

In 1947 Robert T. Hatt repeated Mercer's activities. He found within Actun Lara 
and one other cave more remains of the American horse (in his day it was called 
Equus conversidens), along with bones of other extinct animals. Hatt recommended 
that any future work concentrate on Loltun Cave, where abundant animal and 
cultural remains could be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-WEIGHT: 700">&nbsp;It took until 1977 
before that recommendation bore fruit. Two Mexican archaeologists carried out a 
project that included a complete survey of the complex system of subterranean 
cavities (made by underground water that had dissolved the subsurface 
limestone). They also did stratigraphic excavation in areas in the Loltun 
complex not previously visited. The pits they excavated revealed a sequence of 
16 layers, which they numbered from the surface downward. Bones of extinct 
animals (including mammoth) appear in the lowest layers. </SPAN></P><SPAN

cultural materials were found in levels VII and above. But in some of those 
artifact-bearing strata there were horse bones, even in level II. A radiocarbon 
date for the beginning of VII turned out to be around 1800 BC. The pottery 
fragments above that would place some portions in the range of at least 900–400 
BC and possibly later. The report on this work concludes with the observation 
that "something went on here that is still difficult to explain." Some 
archaeologists have suggested that the horse bones were stirred upward from 
lower to higher levels by the action of tunneling rodents, but they admit that 
this explanation is not easy to accept. The statement has also been made that 
paleontologists will not be pleased at the idea that horses survived to such a 
late date as to be involved with civilized or near-civilized people whose

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; BACKGROUND-POSITION: 0% 0%">”Critical for 
associating human industry with pleistocene fauna is layer VIII, where there is 
no ceramic but where lithic tools and many horse remains appear. But 
unfortunately there are horse [remains] in layers VII and VI and also a very 
small quantity in layer V, all three containing ceramics. <BR><BR>Obviously 
there is some disturbance in these layers. Rodents as well as the most common 
mammals from the cave stand out in studies of the cave's fauna. <BR><BR>The only 
radiocarbon dating published (1805 +- 150) BC was taken using a combined sample 
of various pieces of charcoal and belongs to the area of contact between layers 
VII and VIII. <BR><BR>The stratigraphic and faunal analyses clearly establish 
that the excavated sediments must have accumulated from the Pleistocene era to 
the present, with heavy interference at least from layer VII on up. Only layer 
VIII remains a possible area of occurrence of both lithic material and 
pleistocene bones in a primary context. Unfortunately in neither this layer or 
others is there direct association of human tools with the bones, nor are there 
fire holes where charcoal or bones were clearly used or worked. The same is true 
with layer VII (El Tunel) (p 253).”<BR><BR><BR>[After discussing flora found in 
the cave]. The situation in terms of fauna is more complicated. The majority of 
the animals discovered are represented since the Pleistocene era, having their 
origins in some of the neo-arctic and neotropical fauna. Studying in detail only 
the rodents, a sequence of types of vegetation the caves' surroundings was 
established that is very similar to that accomplished by means of pollen: layers 
before XIII-B, grassland; layers XIII and XII-L, medium jungle; layers XII-K to 
VIII, once again grassland; and from VII to I the current vegetation. These 
changes were not sudden but rather constitute advances and declines of the 
jungle with greater or lesser extension of the grasslands, where large animals 
and certain specialized rodents lived. <BR><BR>Once again the end of pleistocene 
conditions appears to be situated in the region of layers VIII and VII of the 
well "El Toro." Of the four extinct pleistocene species (Mammut americanum, 
Canis diris, Tanupolama, and Equus conversidens) and the three whose 
distribution receded more to the north (Bison bison, Canis lupus, and Canis 
latrans) five did not occur above layer VIII in "El Toro" and layer VII-F in "El 
Tunel." [The exceptions are the bison with three problematic examples in layer 
VI of "El Toro" and the horse, with 44 fragments in layers VII, VI, and V (all 
with ceramics), in "El Toro" and 59 fragments en the subdivisions VII-B and 
VII-E in "El Tunel." What is clear is that the presence of the horse Equus 
conversidens alone cannot be sufficient to declare a layer as pleistocene in its 
entirety, given the long series of combinations of this species with later 
materials in the collections of Mercer, Hatt, and others. Something happened 
here that is still difficult to explain. Horse bones seem to have formed the 
last layer of the Pleistocene or Epi-Pleistocene in various caves, or they must 
have been dragged into the caves decades up to millenia later, something that is 
difficult to accept given the climatic conditions of the Tropics. If we 
postulate a longer survival of the horse than that of other pleistocene animals 
to explain this situation, it would have to extend until almost the beginning of 
the ceramic epoch, which would not please the paleontologists.<BR><BR>Lithic 
Loltun also has not been been very amenable [to exploration]. There are very few 
well-defined techniques for dealing with stone fragments and cores; such 
techniques have varied widely from the beginning to the end. One of the reasons 
may derive from the uselessness of local flint for fine work. In the layers 
considered to be pre-ceramic there are very few tools: scrapers, shavers, 
knife-scrapers, jagged-edged tools (denticulados), and one sharp-ended tool 
(punta), all being of a very reduced size and totaling no more than 11 objects. 
Production techniques are limited to marginal finishing using stone chips and 
plates as the primary materials. <BR><BR>It may seem excessive the detail with 
which we have described the evidence that is so hard to understand about Loltun. 
But I believe that it is necessary because of the site's possible importance and 
because the findings have become widely known without specifying that the usable 
data until now are few and weak. Loltun has been incorporated into general 
theories about Mayan archeology and about the origins of humans in Mesoamerica. 
<BR><BR>Some authors limit themselves to mentioning an association between stone 
artifacts and Pleistocene animal bones, for others there is an association [p. 
256] with Mammoth bones, and in a summary of the most relevant Mayan archeology 
in the last few years the long stratified sequence and the appearance of 
ceramics supposedly dated in 1800 BC is indicated. Regarding this last date, we 
must emphasize that among the first pots found in layer VII of "El Toro" there 
appear some fragments having characteristics of early pottery, but comparisons 
with material from Chiapas and from the Swazey complex in Belize have not given 
positive results, so the most probable date is Middle Preclassic. <BR><BR>The 
preceramic lithic material from Loltun has been tentatively assigned, because of 
it primitive and irregular character, to very early stages, before 14,000 BC. 
Others place it in the transition between the Pleistocene and Holocene and 
compare it with the complex of La Piedra del Coyote in the Guatemalan highlands 
and phase I of the Cave of Santa Martha in Chiapas. In this case it would have 
an age somewhere around 8000 to 10000 BC. It would be a manifestation of the 
Superior Cenolithic or until the Proto-Neolithic, or in other words, the 
Archaic. <BR><BR>In view of the evidence I have described, I lean toward the 
second possibility, and it is possible that its antiquity could be less, if we 
consider the continuity of the lithic of the Preclassic. <BR><BR>There is much 
left to do at Loltun. We are sure that there is an association of humans with 
pleistocene animals, but we must look in the part that has not yet been 
excavated for unmistakable evidence, where the strata have not been disturbed, 
where there is direct association of tools and bones, and direct action with the 
animals. We lack explicit traces of human visits to the cave as a home, places 
of work, or remains of other cultural elements besides only stone chips, and in 
the end, remains of prehistoric humans themselves." (pp.

steppes, the Huns must have had hundreds of thousands of horses. Yet, as the 
Hungarian researcher Sándor Bökönyi puts it with considerable understatement, 
"we know very little of the Huns' horses. It is interesting that not a single

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 4th 
century BC the Huns started to migrate westward from the Ordos region. By the 
3rd century BC they had reached the Transbaikalia and had begun to enter 
Mongolia, which soon became the centre of their empire. Many mounds mark their 
progress. Those in the Zidzha Valley lie at the same latitude as the Pazyryk 
mounds and were subjected to similar conditions of freezing, which helped 
preserve their contents. The richest of the excavated burial sites, however, are 
those of Noin Ula, to the north of Ulaanbaatar, on the Selenge River. Like those 
at Pazyryk, they included horse burials. The furnishings of one tomb were 
especially lavish. The prince for whom it was made must have been in contact 
with China, for his coffin was apparently made for him there, as were some of 
his possessions buried with him (e.g., a lacquer cup inscribed with the name of 
its Chinese maker and dated September 5, AD 13, now in the State Hermitage 
Museum). His horse trappings (State Hermitage Museum) are as elaborately 
decorated as many of those found at Pazyryk. His saddle was covered with leather 
threaded with black and red wool clipped to resemble velvet. The magnificent 
textiles in his tomb included a woven wool rug lined with thin leather (State 
Hermitage Museum); the centre of the rug depicts combat, of Scytho-Altaic 
character, between a griffin and an elk, executed in purple, brown, and white 
felt appliqué work. The animals' bodies are outlined in cord and embroidered. 
The design on another textile is embroidered in the form of a tiger skin with a 
head at each end. The animal's splayed-out body is formed of black and white 
embroidered stripes. Other textiles are of Greco-Bactrian and Parthian origin. 
In some of the Parthian fragments, Central Asian and Sasanian Persian influences 
prevail over Hellenistic ones.</P></DIV></B></FONT>

Hun horse find in Mongolia in 1990.<BR><BR>Ash's example is also problematic 
because bone evidence is not the only evidence we would expect to find in 
Mesoamerica if horses had been domesticated there. There have been a large 
number of human cultural artifacts relating to horses found in Hunnic lands. 
There are a great many <A style="COLOR: #cc0000; TEXT-DECORATION: none"

href="http://chriscarrollsmith.blogspot.com/2008/03/things-you-wont-find-in-book-of-mormon.html">art 
and material culture</A>. That is because horses gave a tremendous military and 
economic advantage to the civilizations that mastered them. Yet in Mesoamerica, 
although we have a great deal of art, including vast numbers of animal 
representations, horses are not depicted. We find no saddles, no bridles, and no 
chariot wheels.<BR><BR>Additionally, it should be noted that some historians 
have called into question how many horses the Huns actually brought with them 
into Europe. The climate and food supplies in Eastern Europe were not as 
well-suited to large numbers of horses as the Asian steppes. According to <A

  Huns had become a sedentary nation and were no longer the horse nomads of the 
  earlier days. The Great Hungarian Plain did not offer as much room as the 
  steppes of Asia for grazing horses, and the Huns were forced to develop an 
  infantry to supplement their now much smaller cavalry. As one leading 
  authority has recently said, "When the Huns first appeared on the steppe north 
  of the Black Sea, they were nomads and most of them may have been mounted 
  warriors. In Europe, however, they could graze only a fraction of their former 
  horse power, and their chiefs soon fielded armies which resembled the 
  sedentary forces of Rome."</BLOCKQUOTE>So, if there is less evidence of Hun 
horses during this period in Europe than we would expect, it may well be because 
the Huns of the region actually did not have as large a number of horses as 
commonly thought. Indeed, <A style="COLOR: #cc0000; TEXT-DECORATION: none"

source</A> suggests that Europe's Great Hungarian plain could have supported no 
more than 20,000.<BR><BR>And finally, it's worth adding that the period of Hun 
rule was quite short compared to the several-thousand-year lacuna of horse 
evidence in the Americas from the generally-accepted Paleolithic extinction date 
to the time of alleged domestication by Book of Mormon peoples. Even if the Hun 
period had been a true lacuna-- which it is not-- it wouldn't really have been 
comparable to the situation in the 
Americas.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>

Began</FONT></SPAN></H3>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-WEIGHT: 700"><FONT 
size=3>During the summers of 1935 and 1936, the University of Wisconsin 
excavated Spencer Lake Mound. The principal investigators were Ralph Linton and 
W. C. McKern; their staff of students included <A 
style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single" 
href="http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeologistss/g/spauldinga.htm">A.C. 
Spaulding</A>, George Quimby, David Stout, and Joffre Coe--all destined to 
become pretty famous archaeologists in their own rights. It was in the fall of 
1936, probably, when a young college student signed up for a beginning 
anthropology course taught by Ralph Linton. The young man, who is known in this 
story only as Mr. P., had been an avid artifact hunter while growing up in 
northwestern Wisconsin. Conversing with his classmates in 1936, Mr. P. 
discovered that excavations at the Spencer Lake Mound the previous summer had 
revealed an astonishing artifact: a horse's skull buried deep within the mound.

Confession</FONT></SPAN></H3>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-WEIGHT: 700"><FONT 
size=3>This was quite a shock to Mr. P. After gathering all of his available 
courage, he went into Linton's office and confessed that in 1928, the then-teen 
aged Mr. P. and a buddy had spent an afternoon pot-hunting the Spencer Lake 
Mound.</FONT></SPAN></P>

size=3>The boys dug a sizeable hole, consuming the better part of a hot 
afternoon, without encountering any kind of a recognizable feature. They were 
about to backfill the opening when one of them suggested that they bury a 
horse's skull that lay along the edge of a nearby field a short distance away. 
This seemed like a brilliant suggestion to the undisciplined minds of the boys, 
so the skull was retrieved and carefully laid in an oriented position at the 
bottom of the excavation before backfilling commenced. Anticipation of the 
probable results of this piece of mischief somehow eased the monotony of the 
backfilling, and the miscreants mutually agreed that in about two hundred years 
some archaeologist would dig up the skull and conclude that he had found 
something really worthwhile [from Mr. P., Wisconsin Archeologist 45(2):120 
(1964)].</FONT></SPAN></P>

size=3>Linton found the story amusing, apparently, and a mightily relieved Mr. 
P. went off onto a career of his own, outside of archaeology. But, either Linton 
didn't tell McKern about the prank or he did tell McKern but McKern didn't 
believe him. For whatever reason, over the next 25 years or so, at least three 
publications--and probably a few others--described the Spencer Lake Mound as 
containing an in situ horse skull.</FONT></SPAN></P>

about it and agreed to prepare a statement of the facts as best he remembered 
them, after 34 years. A copy of this was sent to McKern, who responded with a 
statement to the effect that he was convinced that the skull he excavated was 
not the planted one, but as there was reasonable doubt, he would make some 
revisions [in the monograph] and suggested that his statement be published. Mr. 
P., however, requested that neither his statement nor McKern's be published, a

was resolved. Further evidence (beyond Mr. P.'s complete lack of motive for 
making this story up) was provided by Walter Pelzer, mammologist at the museum 
in those days, who looked at the skull and identified it as a western mustang, a 
horse imported for use on Wisconsin farms in the early 20th century. Pelzer also 
spotted rodent gnawing on all planes of the skull that suggested to him that it 
had been exposed to the weather for a while before being buried. Radiocarbon 
dates of the charcoal recovered from the mound provided a use date for the mound 
between circa 500-1000 AD.</FONT></SPAN></P>

The horse skull only suggested to McKern and others that the Clam River Focus

(i.e., 1700s). But, because there are publications in dusty library stacks 
saying there was a horse skull in Spencer Lake Mound, the rumors continue to 
persist, I suppose on the principle that if it's in print it must be true. But 
no! despite what you may have heard, as far as the evidence shows, the only

wide range of animal life flourishes within and below the rain forest canopies 
of the southern lowlands.&nbsp; Jaguars, ocelots, deer, fox, and rabbits inhabit 
the floor of the rain forest and were all utilized by the May for food, pelts, 
and bone ornaments or tools.&nbsp; Agoutis (small rodents), ant-eating tapirs of 
various sizes, turkeys, and herds of small wild boar (peccaries or havile) also 
abound in the rain forest and were important in the ancient Maya diet, as well 
as in their representations in ceramic art and sculpture (Benson 1977).&nbsp; 
The canopies above are home to lively troops of spider and howler monkeys and to 
a noisy host of exotic birds, including the familiar toucans and parrots in many 
varieties (Murie1935; L.C. Stuart 1964). Especially important in Maya ideology 
and imagery were the ever-present hummingbird and the stunningly beautiful giant 
macaws, with their long bright red or blue-green plumage (Griscom 1932).&nbsp; 
The latter, along with the quetzal from the highland slopes to the south, 
provided much of the plumage for the elaborate headdresses that were a critical 
marker of status for Maya elites, especially rulers.</FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The reptiles and amphibians of the 
rain forest are even more omnipresent in Maya ideology and art, especially the 
caiman (alligator), symbol of the earthly plane of existence, and many varieties 
of snakes, including boas, corals, rattlesnakes, pit vipers, and the most deadly 
barba amarilla (fer-de-lance) and xalpate (bothrops numifer) (Schmidt and 
Andrews 1936).&nbsp; Toads, frogs, and turtles are found in the forest’s lakes, 
swamps, and rivers.&nbsp; The ancient Maya made effective use of these animals 
as well, employing the carapaces of turtles for useful tools ranging from 
musical instruments to hard surfaces for shields, cotton armor, and mosaics in 
headdresses.&nbsp; The lakes, rivers, and swamps also provided important 
elements in the Maya diet, including fish such as mojarra, catfish, and robalo, 
and many types of shellfish.&nbsp; Fish bones were utilized by the ancient Maya 
for needles, awls, and other tools while fragments of shell (some imported from 
the Caribbean or Gulf coasts) were employed for the complex mosaic imagery on 
Maya headdresses, shields, and ornaments, as well as in necklaces and ear 
spools.&nbsp; Even the insect life gave the Maya both symbols and useful 
products, including incenses and honey from wild and domesticated 
hives.</FONT></B></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The density of life in the Peten 
rain forest remains impressive even after two centuries of misguided modern 
settlement and exploitation.&nbsp; In those zones not yet leveled by lumbering 
or settlement, the cacophony of rain forest life – the mingled cries, howls, 
calls, and buzzing of birds, monkeys, frogs and insects – rises in the mornings 
and evenings to a roaring pitch.&nbsp; Taken together, the wildlife and 
vegetation of the rain forest gave the ancient Maya a nearly unlimited supply of 
useful products for subsistence, construction, ornament, and imagery – even 
without considering the agriculture that produced the bulk of their diet.&nbsp; 
The wealth of the rain forest was well understood by the ancient Maya.&nbsp; 
They stood in awe of the jungle and utilized its structure and its inhabitants 
as models for many aspects of their ideology.”</P></DIV></FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>This quote, while admittedly 
lengthy, is important because it brings us to another important avenue for 
discovering the animal life in ancient Mesoamerica – their imagery and ideology. 
&nbsp;Like innumerable others before and since, ancient Mesoamericans included 
the important elements of their daily lives in their imagery and religious 
stories.&nbsp; One extremely important aspect of their ideology, frequently 
portrayed in their imagery, is the idea of the animal companion, or 
<I>way</I>.&nbsp; The idea of a spirit animal companion is one of the most 
important in Mesoamerican ideology.&nbsp; In fact, remnants of this particular 
belief have been found in modern Maya, as demonstrated in Evon Z. Vogt’s essay 
“Daily Life in a Highland Maya Community:&nbsp; Zinacantan in Mid-Twentieth 
Century”, from <U>Ancient Maya Commoners</U>, page 29:</FONT></B></P>

ancestral deities are responsible for installing an inner soul in the embryo of 
every unborn Zinacanteco child.&nbsp; Interaction between the living 
Zinacantecos and the ancestors takes place via these inner souls located in the 
hearts and bloodstreams of persons.&nbsp; The Zinacanteco soul is composed of 
thirteen parts, and a person who loses one or more parts must have a curing 
ceremony to recover them.&nbsp; But the inner soul, though temporarily divisible 
into parts, has some special attributes and is believed to be indestructible and 
eternal.&nbsp; At death, this soul leaves the body and joins a pool of inner 
souls kept by the ancestors.&nbsp; It is later utilized for another person, 
often a grandchild, but while the person is alive, the inner soul as a unit can 
leave the body during sleep and go visiting with the inner souls of other 
Zinacantecos or the deities.&nbsp; It can drop out of the body temporarily in 
periods of intense excitement, such as the point of orgasm in sexual 
intercourse.&nbsp; During life, soul loss can also occur from falling down 
(mothers are very concerned about their children falling) or because of bad 
behavior, such as fighting with kinsmen or mistreating maize, which is punished 
by the ancestors causing the person to fall down or, more dramatically, sending 
a lightning bolt to knock out several parts of the soul.&nbsp; Soul loss can 
also occur when an evil person performs a witchcraft ritual in a cave to “sell” 
the inner soul to the Earth Lord, who then uses the person as a 
servant.</FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>At the same time the ancestors 
install the inner soul in the human embryo, it is also installed in the embryo 
of a wild animal, such as a jaguar, ocelot, coyote, or smaller animal, like a 
squirrel.&nbsp; These animal spirit companions are kept in four corrals inside 
the “Senior Large Mountain,” a large volcano rising majestically to over 9,000 
feet east of Zinacantan Center.&nbsp; Throughout life, the inner soul of a 
person is shared with the animal companion; anything that happens to the person 
happens to the animal and vice versa.&nbsp; When the ancestors are really 
provoked with the behavior of a living person, they will let his/her animal 
spirit companion out of the corral to wander alone in the woods.&nbsp; The life 
of the living person is then in genuine peril, and an elaborate curing ceremony 
must take place promptly to round up the animal companion and place it back in

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The discovery that the Maya 
believed that their elites possessed supernatural spirit companions, or way, has 
been one of the great insights in to ancient Maya worldview (Freidel et al. 
1993; Houston and Stuart 1989;&nbsp; Stuart 1988).&nbsp; The way glyph is a 
depiction of an ajaw.&nbsp; This glyph designates the first day in the Maya 
Tzolkin calendar but also functions as a title for rulers, with half its face 
covered by a jaguar pelt.&nbsp; As currently understood, a way is an animal 
spirit companion, a trance state, and the ability to transform into that spirit 
companion and overcome enemies through bewitchment (Freidel et al. 
1993:190).&nbsp; In the Maya belief system, even the gods have wayob (plural of 
way).&nbsp; In Classic period iconography, the wayob could take the forms of 
humans, animals, and zoomorphic supernaturals.&nbsp; Before the adoption of 
Teotihuacan’s Tlaloc/Venus war complex, jaguarian imagery was associated with 
the most powerful of the wayob.&nbsp; Even after the adoption of this Central 
Mexican war complex, jaguarian imagery continued to feature prominently among 
Maya way imagery.”</P></DIV></FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The essay goes on to describe the 
fascinating story of how, at the time of conquest, the Mesoamericans seemed to 
interpret the Spanish banner image of the Virgin Mary as the Spaniard’s own way, 
and ascribed their defeat to its power.&nbsp; </FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Brant Gardner, a Book of Mormon 
scholar, has suggested that this idea, of Maya elite going into battle with 
their way, often carried on a litter, may have been the original concept that 
Joseph Smith translated as “horse and chariot”.&nbsp; (see Book of Mormon 
Anachronisms, Part 3:&nbsp; Warfare)</FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Aside from this speculation, Book 
of Mormon scholars often insist that the limited references to the horse in the 
Book of Mormon likely mean that the horse may have been restricted to elite 
use.&nbsp; If the horse was important enough to be associated with elite battle 
as a way as Gardner seems to suggest, then surely it would have also found its 
way into the Mesoamerican imagery and ideology, as other animals have.&nbsp; It 
has not.</FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Animals are depicted often in Mesoamerica, outside 
of their portrayal with elite ceremonies.&nbsp; Some of the animals I remember 
seeing depicted in Mesoamerican art or pottery are dogs, spiders, turtles, 
frogs, birds, monkeys, jaguar, peccaries, snakes, crocodiles, fish, bats, 
stingrays, bees, sharks, snails, and rabbits. (For examples, look here: 
http://members.aol.com/emdelcamp/west2.htm) I’m sure there are many more I 
omitted.&nbsp; Some of these animals are characters in mythology, such as we 
find in the Popol Vuh:&nbsp; monkeys, a macaw bird, and a rabbit scribe.&nbsp; 
Deities are often associated with animals, as well, such as Xaman-Ek, Chak, 
Kinich-Ahau, Ah-Muzen-Cab, Ah-Puch, Ah-Tzul, Ek-Zip, Balams, Cama-Zotz, 
Vucub-Caquix, Ixchel, Chac-Xib-Chac, Cit-Bolon-Tum, Copijcha, Coqueela, God P 
(Frog God), Uayeb, Kukulcan, Ix-Chup, Hun-Batz, Hun-Choen, Muan, Nahual, - and 
probably more.&nbsp; </FONT></H2>

<H2><FONT size=3 face=Arial>If we apply the “if…then” test to the existence of 
horses in ancient Mesoamerica, we are left with the highly unlikely proposition 
that: if horses existed in ancient Mesoamerica during the Book of Mormon time 
period, then despite the fact that ancient Mesoamericans depicted many animals 
in art and ideology, they never depicted a horse or included the horse in any of 
their mythology.&nbsp; Added to the complete absence of horse remains during the 
specified time period, and we are left with a highly unlikely 
proposition.</FONT></H2>
<H2><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The burden already seems insurmountable for the Book 
of Mormon horse, but there is yet one more complication.&nbsp; Social scientists 
not only look for physical remains of horses, or depictions of horses in art or 
ideology, but also look for the known impact that horses have on the social 
evolution of the area.</FONT></H2>
<H2><FONT size=3 face=Arial>It is imperative to remember that the original Lehi 
group was already familiar with the horse, and its use associated with 
transportation.&nbsp; While we cannot predict when a group of human beings will 
finally “get it” when it comes to recognizing the potential of the horse, it 
seems extremely unlikely that people coming from a culture that already 
recognized and used this potential would not transfer that knowledge to horses 
in a new setting, particularly when it would give them such an advantage over 
the natives, who apparently had not recognized it.&nbsp; </FONT></H2>
<H2><FONT size=3 face=Arial><A name="Horse Transportation or Food"></A>One of 
the more common claims of Book of Mormon scholars is that since the text does 
not explicitly state that horses were used for transportation, then we cannot 
assume it ever was.&nbsp; In fact they suggest the horse was most likely used as 
a food source.&nbsp; (see Jeff Lindsay’s website essay “It’s My Turn, Questions 
for Anti-Mormons”)&nbsp; A quick review of the horse verses I provided at the 
beginning of this section reveals that there is nothing to indicate horses were 
used as a food source, and, in fact, are mentioned several times in conjunction 
with the chariot.&nbsp; In my opinion, the sole reason some scholars insist that 
horses were a food source and not transportation is in order to avoid the very 
problem I am now addressing: the impact of the horse on human evolution.&nbsp; 
</FONT></H2>
<H2><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Of course, human beings did first use the horse as a 
food source.&nbsp; </FONT></H2>

of the most profound changes in human organization and social behavior have come 
about as the unintended consequences of relatively small, intentional

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Horse domestication almost 
certainly should be understood in this way.&nbsp; It is doubtful that any 
prehistoric genius foresaw the potential capabilities of the wild steppe horse 
as a transport animal.&nbsp; Wild horses are alert, suspicious, large, powerful 
animals, and stallions attack both predators and rival stallions.&nbsp; The 
so-called “wild” horses we know today, such as the mustangs of western North 
America, are feral animals descended from domesticated populations that were 
bred for ease of handling for thousands of years.&nbsp; The truly wild horses of 
the Copper Age probably were more aggressive and tougher than any modern 
horse.&nbsp; Even in zoos and game preserves, Przewalski horse have a reputation 
for being difficult to manage and almost impossible to train as mounts (though 
it has been done).&nbsp; Riding probably began only after horses had been 
domesticated and people were familiar with them as animals that could be 
controlled.&nbsp; It is likely that the original purpose for domesticating wild 
horses was simply to acquire a plentiful and relatively low-maintenance source 
of meat.”</P></DIV></FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Once again, the problem with this 
premise is that the original Lehi group had already been exposed to the horse 
used as transportation.&nbsp; Once the group splintered into two extremely 
antagonistic groups, always attempting to extinguish or conquer the others, the 
proposition that either group would ignore the potential of the horse in that 
contest is highly unlikely.&nbsp; The advantage the horse, used as 
transportation, provides is immense.</FONT></B></P>

almost certainly were first domesticated for use as food animals, like cattle or

many years after), there was no means of transport faster than a rider on 
horseback.&nbsp; Before the invention of firearms, well-trained cavalries 
repeatedly overwhelmed pedestrian military forces, recharting the course of 
ancient history at Issus and Adrianople, and on the barren plains of Asia.&nbsp; 
Horses changed the way people hunted and made war, altered concepts of distance, 
extended interregional trade, brought previously isolated cultures into contact, 
provided new standard of wealth, opened the world’s grasslands to efficient 
human exploitation, and redefined the cultural identities of those societies 
that became equestrian.&nbsp; Horseback riding and horse-drawn chariots may have 
also played a role in the initial spread of the Indo-European languages, a

the history of humankind there has never been an animal that has made a greater

domesticated earlier, but the horse changed the world in innumerable ways with 
its tremendous swiftness. While asses, camels, elephants, yaks, and other 
animals were ridden by people, the horse provided the first source of “rapid 
transit”.&nbsp; Prior to horseback riding, most people traveled on foot, 
carrying all their cargo on their shoulders, or they were restricted to using 
boats along rivers and coastlines.&nbsp; Other animals were slow, limited in how 
much weight they could carry, or were more restricted in their geographic 
distribution.&nbsp; Horses were swift of foot, could easily support one or two 
human passengers, could carry heavy loads, and, like asses, could survive, if

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>One of the arguments Book of 
Mormon scholars sometimes present to counter the claim that horses as a method 
of transportation would have transformed the history of ancient Mesoamerica is 
that the geography of Mesoamerica was simply incongruent with the use of the 
horse as transportation.&nbsp; That certainly may be true of some of the more 
mountainous regions of Mesoamerica, but the story of the Book of Mormon takes 
place over regions of Mesoamerica that were geographically diverse, and included 
areas that would have been quite conducive to the use of the horse as transport; 
and, in fact, after the Conquest, was shown to be conducive in actual 
history.&nbsp; In Sorenson’s book <U>An Ancient American Setting for the Book of 
Mormon</U>, page 247, he states:</FONT></B></P>

city of Nephihah, founded at the same time as Moroni, plausibly is one of a 
cluster of sites of Late Preclassic date located by Sisson a few miles west of 
the Rio Seco frontier.&nbsp; The “plains” near Nephihah (Alma 62:18) would be 
part of the Chontalpa’s extensive, anciently uncultivable, savanna 
grasslands.&nbsp; (Bernard Diaz described one of the earliest Spanish battles on 
the mainland just a little east of here.&nbsp; Thousands of native warriors 
waited to fight them on such a “plain”, and this proved ideal terrain for the 
Spanish horses to maneuver.) Lehi, Morianton, and Moroni seem to have been 
satellites to Nephihah, the regional (market?) center (Alma 51:24; 59:5; 
50:14).&nbsp; Those three were located nearer the coast than Nephihah.&nbsp; But 
Lehi and Morianton must have been very near each other, for their people 
quarreled over agricultural land almost as soon as they settled the places, and 
the Morianton group ended up incorporated politically with Lehi (Alma 50:25-26, 
36).&nbsp; Sites of the correct time period and adjacent to each other were 
located by Sisson coastward from our possible Nephihah and could represent 
remains of those two minor settlements.”</DIV></FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>When the Spanish followers of 
Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas after 1492, their most effective

horseback.&nbsp; The ships of all the voyages were loaded with horses, but so 
many died during the sea crossing that the part of the ocean between Spain and 
the Canary Islands was called the Gulfo de Yeguas (Gulf of Mares) in later 
times.&nbsp; The part of the Atlantic just east of Mexico that is infamous for 
its ceaseless calms became known as the Horse Latitudes, possibly because so 
many horses died while the ships waited for the breeze to stir.&nbsp; Despite 
hazards at sea, by 1503 there were sixty to seventy horses on the island of 
Hispaniola.</FONT></B></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>The first region of North America 
to be colonized by the Spanish was the area around Mexico City, where there was 
good grazing for livestock. &nbsp;&nbsp;Although at first horses were slow to 
breed, within a few years of 1550 there were said to be 10,000 horses in the 
area of Queretaro.&nbsp; These all were descended from a few domestic horses 
that had been released on the grasslands, but because they had no predators, 
their numbers rapidly increased.&nbsp; In South America as well, introduced 
horses soon began to breed in the wild.&nbsp; The city of Buenos Aires was first 
founded by Pedro de Mendoza in 1535, but he was forced to abandon the settlement 
because of a food shortage.&nbsp; He and his compatriots fled across water into 
Paraguay, leaving behind five mares and seven horses.&nbsp; From these, and

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Native Americans of both

its management partly by trial and error and partly from the Spanish from whom 
they received horses through barter and raiding.&nbsp; By the beginning of the 
seventeenth century, members of many of the Plains people of North America had 
become highly skilled horsemen and their way of life had been transformed.&nbsp;

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Before they obtained horses, the 
only forms of transport the peoples of North America had were the canoe, dugout, 
and dog sleigh or travois.&nbsp; The Plains people hunted bison by driving them 
on foot.&nbsp; Once they became horsemen, however, their hunting techniques and 
warfare assumed new patterns and rituals.&nbsp; The Blackfoot hunted bison 
either by a surround or in open chase.&nbsp; In the surround a large number of 
horsemen encircled a herd and milled around it, shooting down animals as they 
rode among them.&nbsp; The case involved a straight rush by mounted men, each of 
whom singled out an animal to shoot and then rode alongside it for the 
kill.&nbsp; A skilled hunter mounted on a trained horse could kill enough 
animals in a single morning to feed a family group of twenty as well as their 
dogs, with enough meat left over for drying.&nbsp; A successful equestrian 
hunter, therefore, had plenty of leisure time for caring for his horses, making 
weapons, and raiding enemy camps.&nbsp; Bison hunts were controlled by strict 
social rules.&nbsp; There were severe penalties for anyone who hunted bison 
before the appointed time.&nbsp; Among the Cheyenne there were only three 
recognized crimes: homicide, disobeying the rules of the bison hunt, and 
repeated horse theft.&nbsp; For committing any of these the culprit was severely

America were in constant interaction through trade, migration, conquest, and 
other contacts.&nbsp; These interactions, as well as some common linguistic and 
ethnic origins, resulted in a sharing of many features across this vast and

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>There is truly an abundance of

constant contact.&nbsp; An entire book of essays deals with the contact between 
the Maya and Teotihuacan, <U>The Maya and Teotihuacan, Reinterpreting Early 
Classic Interaction</U>, edited by Geoffery E. Braswell, which is appropriate to 
my particular point: if horses were of little use in certain areas of Book of 
Mormon lands, the people were in constant contact with groups from other areas 
that had lands very conducive to the use of the horse, and it seems 
extraordinarily unlikely that these people would not have eventually made use of 
the horse in that fashion. </FONT></B></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>So I hope I’ve made two points 
clear by this point: one is that the original Lehi party all would have been 
very familiar with the horse used as transportation, and two, that portions of 
specified Book of Mormon lands were also conducive to the use of the horse as 
transportation, and these areas were also in constant contact with other regions 
that also would have been conducive to the horse.&nbsp; With the understanding 
of these two points, the impact that the horse has on civilization becomes

people (my insert, the speculated first people to ride horses) and other ancient 
Europeans?&nbsp; One way to answer this question is to look at the example of 
those American Indians who also lived in grassland environments, used a similar 
bone-and-stone tool technology, and acquired horses from Europeans under 
circumstances that permit close examination of the implications of riding.&nbsp; 
For them riding was a revolutionary innovation that completely reoriented many 
fundamental aspects of their lives.&nbsp; In both North and South America the 
former dominance of the farming tribes over hunting tribes was reversed within 
two generations after the hunters acquired horses.&nbsp; Religion, status, 
personal identity, warfare, economic productivity, commerce, and the boundaries 
of tribal territories all were redefined once riding began.</SPAN></FONT></B>

times farther and faster than people on foot.&nbsp; Resources, enemies, allies, 
and markets that had previously been beyond effective reach suddenly became 
obtainable.&nbsp; Subsistence and economic survival in the dry grasslands, an 
uncertain and risky proposition for pedestrian hunters, became predictable and 
productive for mounted hunters.&nbsp; Sedentary horticultural villagers whose 
river-valley settlements had been the centers of population and economic 
productivity in the region became vulnerable to lightning-quick raids by enemies 
who could not be pursued or punished.&nbsp; Many of these villages were 
abandoned; and their occupants became mounted hunters in 
self-defense.</SPAN></FONT></P>

Plains Indians, including the Cheyenne, many of the Sioux, and the 
Arapaho.&nbsp; Warfare increased in intensity and social importance, both 
because horses became an easily stolen standard of wealth and because mounted 
societies redrew ethnic boundaries that had been based on pedestrian travel 
distances.&nbsp; Trade and exchange systems extended further, became socially 
more complex, and carried a higher volume of goods (including horses) than had 
been possible before.&nbsp; It is difficult to identify an aspect of Plains 
Indian Culture that was not affected by horseback riding.&nbsp; In North America 
this flurry of innovation went on for a century (from 1650 to 1750) without 
direct European interference, permitting a new type of native culture to evolve 
largely on its own terms.”</P></DIV></SPAN></FONT>

name="Horse Impact on New World"></A>The first advantage immediately noted in 
the New World was the advantage held by the Spaniards in their wartime 
strategies and battles.&nbsp; Although it is difficult to extricate the 
advantage of the horse from the other elements of technological superiority, 
which, ironically, includes other Book of Mormon anachronisms such as steel 
weapons and metal armor, it is still possible to see the importance of the horse 
in this overall picture.&nbsp; The Spaniards, themselves, were well aware of the 
advantage the horse gave them, and at times seemed to view the horses as 
essential as they, themselves, were.&nbsp; The following quotes from Jared 
Diamond’s <U>Guns, Germs, and Steel</U> demonstrate this

tremendous advantage that the Spaniards gained from their horses leaps out of 
the eyewitness accounts.&nbsp; Horsemen could easily outride Indian sentries 
before the sentries had time to warn Indian troops behind them, and could ride 
down and kill Indians on foot.&nbsp; The shock of a horse’s charge, its 
maneuverability, the speed of attack that it permitted, and the raised and 
protected fighting platform that it provided left foot soldiers nearly helpless 
in the open.&nbsp; Nor was the effect of horses due only to the terror that they 
inspired in soldiers fighting against them for the first time.&nbsp; By the time 
of the great Inca rebellion of 1536, the Incas had learned how best to defend 
themselves against cavalry, by ambushing and annihilating Spanish horsemen in 
narrow passes.&nbsp; But the Incas, like all other foot soldiers, were never 
able to defeat cavalry in the open.&nbsp; When Quizo Yupanqui, the best general 
of the Inca emperor Manco, who succeeded&nbsp; Atahuallpa, besieged the 
Spaniards in Lima in 1536 and tried to storm the city, two squadrons of Spanish 
cavalry charged a much larger Indian force on flat ground, killed Quizo and all 
of his commanders in the first charge, and routed his army.&nbsp; A similar 
cavalry charge of 26 horsemen routed the best troops of Emperor Manco himself, 
as he was besieging the Spaniards in Cuzco.&nbsp; </FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The transformation of warfare by 
horses began with their domestication around 4000 BC, in the steppes north of 
the Black Sea.&nbsp; Horses permitted people possessing them to cover far 
greater distances than was possible on foot, to attack by surprise, and to flee 
before a superior defending force could be gathered.&nbsp; Their role at 
Cajamarca thus exemplifies a military weapon that remained potent for 6,000 
years, until the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, and that was eventually applied 
on all the continents. Not until the First World War did the military dominance 
of cavalry finally end.&nbsp; When we consider the advantages that Spaniards 
derived from horses, steel weapons, and armor against foot soldiers without 
metal, it should no longer surprise us that Spaniards consistently won battles 
against enormous odds.”&nbsp; (page 76)</P></DIV></FONT></B>

numerous, killing thousands of natives while not losing a single Spaniard.&nbsp; 
Time and again, accounts of Pizarro’s subsequent battles with the Incas, 
Cortes’s conquest of the Aztecs, and other early European campaigns against 
Native Americans describe encounters in which a few dozen European horsemen 
routed thousands of Indians with great slaughter.&nbsp; During Pizarro’s march 
from Cajamarca to the Inca capital of Cuzco after Atahuallpa’s death, there were 
four such battles:&nbsp; at Jauja, Vilcashuanman, Vilcaconga, and Cuzco.&nbsp; 
Those four battles involved a mere 80, 30, 110, and 40 Spanish horsemen, 
respectively, in each case ranged against thousands or tens of thousands of 
Indians.&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT>

off as due merely to the help of Native American allies, to the psychological 
novelty of Spanish weapons and horses, or (as is often claimed) to the Incas’ 
mistaking Spaniards for their returning god Viracocha.&nbsp; The initial 
successes of both Pizarro and Cortes did attract native allies.&nbsp; However, 
many of them would not have become allies if they had not already been 
persuaded, by earlier devastating successes of unassisted Spaniards, that 
resistance was futile and that they should side with the likely winners.&nbsp; 
The novelty of horses, steel weapons, and guns undoubtedly paralyzed the Incas 
at Cajamarca, but the battles after Cajamarca were fought against determined 
resistance by Inca armies that had already seen Spanish weapons and horses. 
Within a half dozen years of the initial conquest, Incas mounted two desperate, 
large scale, well-prepared rebellions against the Spaniards.&nbsp; All those 
efforts failed because of the Spaniards’ far superior armament.” (page

animals were ridden by people, the horse provided the first source of “rapid

carrying all their cargo on their shoulders, or they were restricted to using 
boats along rivers and coastlines.&nbsp; Other animals were slow, limited in how 
much weight they could carry, or were more restricted in their geographic

let us spell out the origin of the Jaredites in historical and cultural 
terms.&nbsp; When did the Jaredites originate as a people?&nbsp; Historical 
texts and archaeological research on Mesopotamia, their homeland, tells us that 
big pyramid-shaped temple platforms called ziggurats were being erected well 
before 3000 B.C.&nbsp; Nothing but one of them qualifies as “the great tower” 
referred to in Ether 1:33.&nbsp; If the departure of the Jaredite party from 
their original home had been many centuries later than 3000 B.C. or earlier than 
about 3300 B.C., their account about “the great tower” would sound odd in terms 
of Near Eastern history.&nbsp; (Incidentally, the zero date from which the 
Mesoamerican calendars were calculated was 3113 B.C., which might or might not 
be a coincidence.)&nbsp; We have already seen that the earliest evidences of 
some of the basic indicators of civilization – stable agriculture, village life, 
and ceramics – date in Mesoamerica to about 3000 B.C.</FONT></B>
<P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>There is no sound evidence, by the 
way, to support the idea from outmoded biblical commentaries that the great 
tower (“of Babel”) dated to near 2200 B.C., as some Latter-day Saints continue 
to believe.&nbsp; Indeed, contrary data abound.”</P></DIV></FONT></B>
<P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>This early date is quite 
problematic in terms of Mesoamerican history.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Olmec culture, the 
only culture that achieved the necessary level of social stratification to 
qualify as either the Jaredite culture or the culture in which the Jaredites 
participated, did not achieve that level of social stratification until much 
later.&nbsp; If we accept Sorenson’s dating and argument, the case is already 
closed.&nbsp; San Lorenzo, the city Sorenson cites as Lib, is the earliest Olmec 
city to achieve the necessary social stratification.&nbsp; Richard Diehl, in his 
book <U>The Olmecs, America’s First Civilization</U>, page 29,

Lorenzo emerged as Mesoamerica’s first city, and perhaps the oldest urban center 
anywhere in the Americas, by 900 B.C.&nbsp; By then it covered 500 ha (1,235 
acres), had several thousand permanent residents, and exhibited the full range 
of urban characteristics outlined by Christine Niederberger:&nbsp; political and 
religious power, social ranking, planned public architecture, highly skilled 
craftspeople, control of interregional trade networks, and complex intellectual 
achievements.&nbsp; Today it is clear that the Olmec capitals at San Lorenzo and 
La Venta were what William T. Sanders and David Webster define as Regal-Ritual 
Cities: urban centers that have highly developed ritual functions but fairly 
modest populations, relatively weak, decentralized rulership, and limited 
economic functions.&nbsp; Regal-Ritual Cities were common later in Mesoamerican 
societies, where only Teotihuacan, Tula, and Tenochtitlan and a few other 
mega-centers advanced beyond this stage.” </DIV></FONT></B>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>As Sorenson’s book is decades old, 
it is possible that he did not have access to the level of detail we currently 
do regarding the Olmec civilization, and hence, believed the early date was 
viable.&nbsp; However, other Book of Mormon scholars, like Brant Gardner, 
adamantly reject the early dating, and seems to be more comfortable with a date 
around 1500 BC.&nbsp; (<A

English sounded musical to Indians’ ears.&nbsp; Instead, the replacement 
entailed English-speaking immigrants’ killing most Indians by war, murder, and 
introduced diseases, and the surviving Indians’ being pressured into adopting 
English, the new majority language.&nbsp; The immediate causes of that language

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>With the exception of the 
Eskimo-Aleut language family of the American Arctic and the Na-Dene language 
family of Alaska, northwestern Canada, and the US Southwest, the Americas lack 
examples of large-scale language expansions widely accepted by linguists.&nbsp; 
Most linguists specializing in Native American languages do not discern large, 
clear-cut groupings other than Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene.&nbsp; At most, they 
consider the evidence sufficient only to group other Native American languages 
(variously estimated to number from 600 to 2,000) into a hundred or more 
language groups or isolated languages.&nbsp; A controversial minority view is 
that of the linguist Joseph Greenberg, who groups all Native American languages 
other than Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene languages into a single large family, termed 
Amerind, with about a dozen subfamilies.</FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Some of Greenberg’s subfamilies, 
and some groupings recognized by more traditional linguists, may turn out to be 
the legacies of New World population expansions driven in part by food 
production.&nbsp; These legacies may include the Uto-Aztecan languages of New 
World population expansions driven in part by food production.&nbsp; These 
legacies may include the Uto-Aztecan languages of Mesoamerica and the western 
United States, the Oto-Manguean languages of Mesoamerica, the Natchez-Muskogean 
languages of the US Southeast, and the Arawak languages of the West 
Indies.&nbsp; But the difficulties that linguists have in agreeing on groupings 
of Native American languages reflect the difficulties that complex Native 
American societies themselves faced in expanding within the New World.&nbsp; Had 
any food producing Native American peoples succeeded in spreading far with their 
crops and livestock and rapidly replacing hunter-gatherers over a large area, 
they would have left legacies of easily recognized language families, as in 
Eurasia, and the relationships of Native American languages would not be so 
controversial.</FONT></B></P>

possibility, due to the fact that it is, indeed, related to the horse.&nbsp; So 
if we accept that the “namer” chose to call it a “horse” without any qualifiers, 
such as “horse that man does not ride”, or “strange looking solitary horse”, or 
“horse with a snout”, then we must analyze the context in which the animal is 
cited in the Book of Mormon to see if the tapir could fulfill that context.

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>&nbsp;First, for reference, there 
are two articles that discuss the tapir as the “horse” on the FARMs website, the 
aforementioned “Horses in the Book of Mormon” and “Unanswered Mormon 
Scholars”.&nbsp; One source in particular is cited in each article, although 
“Unanswered Mormon Scholars” does not provide a full reference.&nbsp; The source 
is article written by Fradich and Thenius called Tapirs in the old series 
Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia, Volume 13, Mammals IV, page 29.&nbsp; Both 
articles make mention of the noted similarities between the horse and the tapir, 
as well as noting that a tapir can be domesticated if captured young, and that 
in Brazil some farmers used them to pull ploughs.&nbsp; I was fascinated by 
these claims, particularly the latter, since none of the information I found 
about tapirs on the Internet seemed to support the idea of a tapir being used as 
a domesticated draft animal.&nbsp; In fact, the information I read seemed to 
contradict the idea for two main reasons.&nbsp; One is that the tapir is not a 
herd animal, and second is that the tapir is a shy animal that can demonstrate 
extreme behavior under captivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the particular 
tapir in question would be the Tapirus Bairdi, Baird’s tapir, although there are 
more similarities than differences between the different species.</FONT></B></P>

first discoverers of America, Columbus, Pinzon, and Cabral, probably had not yet 
encountered the tapirs.&nbsp; However, towards the end of the year 1500, Peitro 
Martyr described an animal “of the size of an ox”, of the color of cattle, which 
has “an elephant’s trunk and hooves like a horse,” but which, after all, is 
neither cattle, nor elephant, nor horse.&nbsp; The later explorers of America 
soon became familiar with the lowland tapir, although initially they did not 
know to which group of animals he actually belonged….</FONT></B>
<P></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>At first glance, the tapirs’ 
movements also are not similar to those of their relatives, the rhinoceros and 
the horses.&nbsp; In a slow walk, they usually keep the head lowered.&nbsp; In a 
trot, they lift their heads and move their legs in an elastic manner.&nbsp; The 
amazingly fast gallop is seen only when the animals are in flight, playing, or 
when they are extremely excited.&nbsp; The tapirs can also climb quite well, 
even though one would not expect this because of their bulky figure.&nbsp; Even 
steep slopes do not present obstacles. They jump vertical fences or walls, 
rising on their hindlegs and leaping up.&nbsp; Some zoo people have found that 
they are able to squeeze themselves through unbelievably narrow gaps or between 
bars, or that they “sneak” out under lower bars with their backs arched.&nbsp; 
These abilities are of advantage in the wild when they wander through jungles of 
bamboo and reed…</FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The tapirs prefer to stay in the 
vicinity of water.&nbsp; They are excellent swimmers and cross even wide streams 
without great effort.&nbsp; In order to feed on aquatic plants or to escape when 
pursued, they also are able to dive quite well…</FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>All species of tapir are similar 
in their habits.&nbsp; They are unsocial, cautious creatures of the forest, who 
avoid open territory and depend on the vicinity of water.&nbsp; In denser 
populated areas of human settlements, the South American lowland tapirs are 
considered to be strictly nocturnal animals, according to Hans Krieg.&nbsp; One 
hardly ever sees them unless they are routed out of their hiding places by 
dogs.&nbsp; “In places with few people,” Krieg continues, “it is possible to see 
tapirs at any time, except for the hottest time around noon;&nbsp; most likely, 
however, one can see them in the morning and in the evening.&nbsp; But these 
encounters were not at all commonplace, even though, with some knowledge of the 
area, one could expect to see them at certain places at a certain 
time.”</B></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B></B></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Water plays such an important part 
in the habitat of all tapirs that they really should have a pool in their zoo 
pens.&nbsp; A substitute in zoos may be an occasional shower with a hose.&nbsp; 
The animals frequently extend their daily bath during the hottest time of the 
day; not only does this cool off the animals, but it also protects them from 
biting insects and other parasites of the skin.&nbsp; It is easy to recognize a 
tapir’s wallow, not only by the characteristic three-toed footprints but also by 
the feces which are frequently found in the surroundings.&nbsp; Hans Krieg often 
saw manure scattered on the ground of the forest and floating on the 
water.&nbsp; Whenever possible, the tapirs defecate into the water or in the 
immediate vicinity of a water hole or water container.&nbsp; Wolfgang von 
Richter assumes that the vagus nerve (which also affects the digestive system) 
is stimulated as soon as the animals come into contact with 
water…</FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>When highly excited, tapirs will 
spray their urine about diffusely.&nbsp; For example, in the Frankfurt Zoo a 
male tapir was forced out of his warm stable into the cold winter air. At first 
he resisted all attempts to make him leave his quarters.&nbsp; Eventually, he 
stood on the threshold and smelled the cold air, and then suddenly he sprayed 
backward.&nbsp; The keeper, who was gently trying to push him outside, was 
sprayed full force with urine.</B></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>Except in the mating season, 
tapirs in the wild are usually unsociable loners.&nbsp; One hardly ever sees 
more than three animals together.&nbsp; Keeping them in pairs or even in family 
groups the year round, as is usually done in zoological gardens, is basically 
unbiological.&nbsp; In spite of this fact, they usually get along well with one 
another, even in relatively small enclosures, or better, they coexist beside 
each other.&nbsp; They pay hardly any attention to their pen mates.&nbsp; 
Serious squabbles occur as rarely as does playing together.&nbsp; There also 
seem to be no rank order within the group.</B></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B></B></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>In all places in their South 
American habitat where the land is being cultivated, the number of tapirs 
decreases steadily.&nbsp; The South American Indians kill them for their skin, 
their meat, or both.&nbsp; They use poisoned arrows and occasionally chase them 
with dogs.&nbsp; When pursued, the animals plunge into the water.&nbsp; Then 
they will be killed from a boat with spears and knives.&nbsp; However, the tapir 
population is not really endangered by the hunting Indians.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
some Indian tribes prohibit the killing of tapirs for religious reasons.&nbsp; 
Their main enemies are the white or half-white settlers who in most cases kill 
these harmless vegetarians “just for the fun of it”.&nbsp; In the villages, one 
often finds young orphan tapirs whose mothers have been killed.&nbsp; They 
become as tame as dogs within a few days.&nbsp; They like to be petted and even 
let the children ride on their backs.&nbsp; In spite of these characteristics, 
which are suitable for domestication, there have been few attempts to actually 
domesticate tapirs.&nbsp; According to several reports, only in the last century 
have the German-Brazilian settlers in Santa Caterina occasionally tamed 
tapirs.&nbsp; On remote farms, they have even used them to pull their ploughs. 
</B></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>So far, only very few Central 
American tapirs have been kept in zoological gardens.&nbsp; By chance, an 
occasional animal may come into one of the smaller Central American zoos.&nbsp; 
This large tapir probably does as well in captivity as the lowland tapir and 
may, according to L. S. Crandall, reach a similarly old age.&nbsp; In the New 
York zoo a male lived for fourteen years; in Chicago a female reached 
approximately twenty-seven years.&nbsp; In 1967 each of the zoos in Philadelphia 
and San Francisco had one female Central American tapir.&nbsp; So far, 
reproduction occurred only in a few individual cases.”</P></DIV></B></FONT>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B>The section which refers to the 
farmers using them to pull ploughs has been cited as support for the possibility 
that the tapir was the Book of Mormon “horse”, yet the sentence specifically 
states that there have been few attempts to domesticate tapirs, and it’s only in 
the last century some Brazilian farmers attempted to do so.&nbsp; This was 
completely omitted from the FARMs article, which I find misleading.&nbsp; If 
human beings who have lived in the same areas as tapirs for centuries rarely 
domesticate them, this tells us something about their suitability for 
domestication.&nbsp; One difficulty, particularly in keeping them in groups, has 
to do with the fact that they do not have a rank order, or, in other words, they 
are not a herd animal.&nbsp; Jared Diamond, in <U>Guns, Germs, and Steel</U> 
discusses the domestication of animals in various cultures, as well as the 
fallacious idea that some cultures may not have domesticated animals that could 
have been domesticated for cultural reasons.&nbsp; (as some have suggested in 
regards to the “horse” in Mesoamerica)</B></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>The answer to that question is 
unequivocal: No!&nbsp; The interpretation is refuted by five types of 
evidence:&nbsp; rapid acceptance of European domesticates by non-European

if some local wild mammal species of those continents had been domesticable, 
some Australian, American, and African peoples would have domesticated them and 
gained great advantage from them, just as they benefited from the Eurasian 
domestic animals that they immediately adopted when they became available.&nbsp; 
For instance, consider all the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa living within the 
range of wild zebras and buffalo.&nbsp; Why wasn’t there at least one African 
hunter-gatherer tribe that domesticated those zebras and buffalo and thereby 
gained sway over other Africans, without having to wait the arrival of Eurasian 
horses and cattle?&nbsp; All these facts indicate that the explanation for the 
lack of native mammal domestication outside Eurasia lay with the locally 
available wild mammals themselves, not with the local peoples.”&nbsp; (page

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>We could very well substitute the 
words “tapir” and “Mesoamericans” for “zebras” and “African” in the preceding

people, not just by a small group of foreigners from the Old World.&nbsp; Yet, 
outside of a few isolated attempts, they have not been.&nbsp; The reason for

second type of evidence for the same interpretation comes from pets. Keeping 
wild animals as pets, and taming them, constitute an initial stage in 
domestication.&nbsp; But pets have been reported from virtually all traditional 
human societies on all continents.&nbsp; The variety of wild animals thus tamed 
is far greater than the variety eventually domesticated, and includes some 
species we would scarcely have imagined as pets.”</DIV></FONT></B>

pets, such as kangaroos, possums, cassowaries, eagles, cheetahs, gazelles, 
hartebeests, cranes, giraffes, and the brown bear.&nbsp; He comments:&nbsp; 
“Over a century ago, the British scientist Francis Galton summarized this 
discrepancy succinctly:&nbsp; “It would appear that every wild animal has had 
its chance at being domesticated, that [a] few… were domesticated long ago, but 
that the large remainder, who failed sometimes in only one small particular, are 
destined to perpetual wildness.” (page 165)</FONT></B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>Diamond shares even more evidence 
that only certain species are suitable for domestication.&nbsp; All big animal 
species suitable for domestication at all were domesticated within the first few 
thousand years of the sedentary farming-herding societies’ development.&nbsp; 
Also, DNA evidence shows that big mammals sub species that were domesticated in 
different parts of the world diverged from the same population.&nbsp; Also, 
modern efforts to domesticate big mammals that were not already domesticated 
have largely failed.&nbsp; Hence, it is some quality of the animal itself that 
lends to domestication, and not the particular peoples.&nbsp; Diamond isolates 
six groups of reasons for failed domestication.&nbsp; </FONT></B></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><SPAN style="COLOR: black"><B>“All of 
which were useful unto man” indicates a domesticated animal used for a specific 
purpose, not a trained pet.&nbsp; So we are left with this proposition:&nbsp; if 
the Book of Mormon “horse” is really a tapir, then tapirs were domesticated only 
by one small group of people, never to be replicated by anyone else, despite 
sharing characteristics that disqualify large mammals from domestication.&nbsp;

style="COLOR: black; FONT-WEIGHT: 700">These passages also demonstrate another 
difficulty I have not yet addressed, which is that the horse is not the sole 
animal X that requires a Central American counterpart.&nbsp; Most notable 
cattle, asses, and oxen also require a potential candidate.&nbsp; Very few 
suggest potential candidates offered other than the deer or tapir – for good 
reason, they are the only candidates that can be considered at all, out of 
native Central American large mammals.&nbsp; The deer has already been 
eliminated for “horse” and could be eliminated for cattle, asses, and oxen for 
the same reason.&nbsp; All the “namers” were familiar with all of these 
animals.&nbsp; So are we to assume that the “namer” was using a variety of names 
all to describe “tapir”?&nbsp; If so, the text can only be described as 
nonsense.&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></P>

“if….then” questions that need to be evaluated in context.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><SPAN 
style="COLOR: black; FONT-WEIGHT: 700"></SPAN></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><I><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>if the horse did exist in 
Mesoamerica during Book of Mormon times, then not a single bone or tooth from 
any of these horses has ever been discovered, despite the fact that the remains 
of an abundance of other animals have been discovered in 
Mesoamerica</FONT></B></I></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><I><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial></FONT></B></I>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><I><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>if horses existed in ancient 
Mesoamerica during the Book of Mormon time period, then despite the fact that 
ancient Mesoamericans depicted many animals in art and ideology, they never 
depicted a horse or included the horse in any of their 
mythology</FONT></B></I></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=3 face=Arial><B></B></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><I><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial>if the horse existed in 
Mesoamerica since Jaredite times, then it left no trace of the sort of social 
evolutionary impact that we see in other cultures that possessed the 
horse</FONT></B></I></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><B><FONT size=3 face=Arial><SPAN

other peoples in other parts of the world, as well.&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></P>
