      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Young Joe Smith in His Father's Boots. --</B> From the 
        correspondent of the Cincinatti <I>Gazette,</I> we get the particulars 
        of the formal installation at Amoby, lee county, Illinois, on the 6th of 
        April, of Joe Smith as "Prophet, Seer, and Revelator in Zion," as 
        successor to his father, in the Mormon Church. <BR><BR>There were 
        present fifty male and female Mormons from Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and 
        Ohio. Joe Smith made an address, saying that he of late had been having 
        revelations through the Holy Spirit of the will of God; he said that for 
        two or three years past the Church has been exciting the wrath of God, 
        and that he (Smith) had now reorganized it, and that the doctrines of 
        Brigham Young he holds in abhorrence. <BR><BR>Furthermore, he said: 
        <BR><SMALL><BR>"I believe that a man owes duties to the country in which 
        he lives -- that he is amenable to the laws of the land, and that he is 
        liable to have that duty enforced upon him by those laws; and I say that 
        Mormons can so act that they shall have as many friends as the people of 
        any sect. <BR><BR>"I hold in entire abhorrence many of the doctrines 
        preached and promulgated by Brigham Young. I have been told that my 
        father promulgated these same doctrines -- the doctrines of Young. This 
        I never did believe, and I never can believe it, for the doctrines were 
        not promulgated by Divine authority; and I believe that my father was a 
        good man, and no good man could have promulgated such odious doctrines. 
        <BR><BR>"I believe in the unity of the Church, and in truth and honesty, 
        and all these I find in the Bible, and in the Book of Mormon, and in the 
        'Book of Doctrine and Covenants,' which latter books are but auxiliaries 
        to the first." <BR></SMALL><BR>Presidents of Seventies, Presidents of 
        Quorums, and a Bishop were then chosen, and prayers offered up for the 
        "Saints in bindage in Utah." <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note: 
        See the <I>New York Times</I> of April 11, 1860 for a report similar to 
        that published by the <I>Cincinatti Gazette.</I> The <I>Times</I> adds 
        this line: "Now, I have my own peculiar notions in regard to revelation, 
        and I am happy to say, in the face of this meeting, that the voice of 
        those with whom I have conversed among this people is, that they concur 
        with me." <BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><BR></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><A

      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>Washington, March 31. -- Official information has 
        been received of Colonel Conner's severe battle and splendid victory on 
        Bear, River, Washington Territory. After a forced march of one hundred 
        and forty miles, in midwinter and through deep snows, in which 
        seventy-six of his men were disabled by frozen feet, he and his gallant 
        band of only two hundred men attacked three h'undred Indian warriors in 
        their stronghold, and after a hard-fought battle of four hours, 
        destroyed the entire band, leaving two hundred and twenty-four dead upon 
        the field. Our loss was fourteen killed and forty-nine wounded. These 
        Indians had murdered several miners during the winter, and were part of 
        the same band who had been massacring emgrants on the overland Mail 
        route for the last fifteen years, and the principal actors and leaders 
        in the horrid crimes of last summer. During Colonel Conner's march no 
        assistance was rendered by the Mormons, who seemed indisposed, he says, 
        to divulge any information regarding the Indians, and charged enormous 
        prices for every article furnished his command. <BR><FONT color=maroon

      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>When, some two years ago, I ceased connection with 
        the <I>Presbyterian Banner,</I> it was my expectation that this 
        retirement was final.... Yet scarecely had I returned to the exclusive 
        work of preaching the Gospel, when regreats from many quarters were 
        expressed... We now enter upon our work fully sensible of its great 
        requirements, but also looking up to our Father who is in haven, for his 
        help, and earnestly desiring the indulgence and cooperation of the 
        readers and patrons of the <I>Banner...</I> <BR><BR>It is to me a source 
        of the highest gratification to be able to say to the public that Prof. 
        Robert Patterson, formerly of Jefferson College, Pa., but now of Centre 
        College, Danville, Ky., is to be associated with myself. He bears a name 
        familiar for half a century to the people of Western Pennsylvania. he is 
        an accomplished scholar, a forcible and polished writer, a man of the 
        highest integrity, and at the same time the gentle and modest 
        Christian.... Just so soon as the Professor can be released from his 
        engagements with the College, he will enter upon his new duties. 
        <BR><BR>In behalf of myself and colleague, I give you these, our 
        salutations.

        &nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>March 26, 1869. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp;</SMALL> </P>Some time since, I became the owner of <I>The Book of 
        Mormon,</I> I put it into the hands of Mr. Joseph Miller, Sr., of Amwell 
        Township. After examining it, he makes the following statement 
        concerning the connection of Rev. Solomon Spalding with the authorship 
        of <I>The Book of Mormon,</I> <BR><BR>Mr. Miller is now in the 
        seventy-ninth year of his age. He is an Elder in the Cumberland 
        Presbyterian Church. His judgment is good, and his veracity 
        unimpeachable. He was well acquainted with Mr. Spalding, while he lived 
        at Amity. He waited on him during his last illness. He made his coffin, 
        and assisted to bury his remains where they now lie, in the Presbyterian 
        graveyard at Amity. he also bailed Mr. Spalding's wife when she took out 
        Letters of Administration on his estate. <BR><BR>Mr. Miller's statement 
        may be relied upon as true. <BR>
        <P align=right>J. W. Hamilton &nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>(pastor, Presbyterian 
        Church) &nbsp; &nbsp;</P><A name=Miltop>&nbsp;</A> 
        <BR><BR><BR><SMALL>When Mr. Spalding lived in Amity, Pennsylvania, I was 
        well acquainted with him. I was frequently at his house. He kept what 
        was called a tavern. It was understood that he had been a preacher, but 
        his health failed him and he ceased to preach. I never knew him to 
        preach after he came to Amity. <BR><BR>He had in his possession some 
        papers which he said he had written. He used to read select portions of 
        these papers to amuse us [of] evenings. <BR><BR>These papers were 
        detached sheets of foolscap. He said he wrote the papers as a novel. He 
        called it <I>The Manuscript Found,</I> or <I>The Lost Manuscript 
        Found.</I> He said he wrote it to pass away the time when he was unwell; 
        and, after it was written, he thought he would publish it as a novel, as 
        a means to support his family. <BR><BR>Some time since, a copy of <I>The 
        Book of Mormon</I> came into my hands. My son read it for me, as I have 
        a nervous shaking of the head that prevents me from reading. I noticed 
        several passages which I recollect having heard Mr. Spalding read from 
        his <I>Manuscript.</I> One passage, on page 148 (the copy I have is 
        published by J. O. Wright &amp; Co., New York) I remember distinctly. He 
        speaks of a battle, and says the Amalekites had <I>marked</I> themselves 
        with <I>red</I> on their foreheads to distinguish them from the 
        Nephites. The thought of being marked on the forehead was so strange, it 
        fixed itself in my memory. This, together with other passages, I 
        remember to have heard Mr. Spalding read from his <I>Manuscript.</I> 
        <BR><BR>Those who knew Mr. Spalding will soon all be gone and I among 
        the rest. I write that what I know may become a matter of history; and 
        that it may prevent people from being led into Mormonism, that most 
        seductive delusion of the devil. <BR><BR>From what I know of Mr. 
        Spalding's <I>Manuscript</I> and <I>The Book of Mormon,</I> I firmly 
        believe that Joseph Smith, by some means, got possession of Mr. 
        Spalding's <I>Manuscript,</I> and possibly made some changes in it and 
        called it <I>The Book of Mormon.</I>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Messrs. Editors: --</I> <BR><BR>Here on business with the 
        Government, I have accidentally found, in the <I>Wheeling 
        Intelligencer</I> of the 8th instant, an article copied from your paper, 
        under the caption, "Who Wrote The Book of Mormon?" The statement of 
        Joseph Miller, Sr., enclosed in the communication of your correspondent, 
        J. W. Hamilton, carries me back, in memory, to scenes and occurrences of 
        my youth, at the pleasant old Village of Amity, in your County; and are 
        corroborative, in some measure, of their conjectures as to the real 
        author of that curious production, the "Mormon Bible." <BR><BR>With a 
        view to throw some additional light upon a subject which, in the future, 
        if not at present, may possess historical importance, I have concluded 
        to employ a leisure hour in giving you some of my recollections, 
        touching the <I>Lost History Found,</I> and its author. <BR><BR>In the 
        [Fall] of 1814, I arrived in the village of "Good Will:" and, for 
        eighteen or twenty months, sold goods in the store previously occupied 
        by Mr. Thomas Brice. It was on the Main-street, a few rods West of 
        Spalding's tavern where I was a boarder. <BR><BR>With [both] Mr. Solomon 
        Spalding and his wife, I was quite intimately acquainted. He was 
        regarded as an amiable, inoffensive, intelligent old gentleman, of some 
        sixty winters; and as having been formerly a Teacher or Professor in 
        some eastern Academy or College; but I was not aware of his having been 
        a preacher or called "Reverend." He was afflicted with a rupture, which 
        made locomotion painful, and confined him much to his house. They 
        possessed but little of this world's goods; and, as I understood, 
        selected Amity as a residence, because it was a healthy and inexpensive 
        place to live in. <BR><BR>I recollect, quite well, Mr. Spalding spending 
        much time in writing on sheets of paper (torn out of an old book), what 
        purported to be a veritable history of the nations or tribes who 
        inhabited Canaan when, or before, that country was invaded by the 
        Israelites, under Joshua. He described, with great particularity, their 
        numbers, customs, modes of life; their wars, stratagems, victories, and 
        defeats &amp;c. His style was flowing and grammatical, though gaunt and 
        abrupt -- very like the stories of the "Maccabees" and other apocryphal 
        books, in the old bibles. He called it <I>Lost History Found, -- Lost 
        Manuscript,</I> or some such name: not disguising that it was wholly a 
        work of the imagination, written to amuse himself, and without any 
        immediate view to publication. <BR><BR>I read, or hear[d] him read, many 
        wonderful and amusing passages from different parts of his professed 
        historical records; and was struck with the minuteness of his details 
        and the apparent truthfulness and sincerity of the author. Defoe's 
        veritable Robinson Crusoe was not more reliable. <BR><BR>I have an 
        indistinct recollection of the passages referred to by Mr. Miller, about 
        the Amalekites making a cross with red paint on their foreheads, to 
        distinguish them from their enemies in the confusion of battle; but the 
        manuscript was full of equally ludicrous descriptions. After my removal 
        to Wheeling, in 1818, I understood <FONT color=maroon size=3>[note: from 
        Dr. Cephas Dodd, perhaps]</FONT> that Mr. Spalding had died and his 
        widow had returned to her friends in northern Ohio or western New York. 
        She would naturally take the manuscript with her. Now, it was in 
        northern Ohio, probably in Lake or Ashtabula County, that the first 
        Mormon prophet, or impostor, Jo Smith, lived and published what he 
        called <I>The Book of Mormon,</I> or the "Mormon Bible." It is quite 
        probable therefore, that, with some alterations, <I>The Book of 
        Mormon</I> was, in fact, <I>The Lost Book,</I> or <I>Lost History 
        Found,</I> of my old landlord, Solomon Spalding, of Amity, Washington 
        County, Pennsylvania. <BR><BR>I have also a recollection of reading, in 
        some newspaper, about the time of my removal to California, in 1850, an 
        article on this subject, charging Jo Smith, directly, with purloining 
        or, in some improper way, getting possession of a certain manuscript 
        which an aged clergyman had written for his own amusement, as a novel, 
        and <I>out of it making, up his pretended Mormon Bible.</I> Smith's 
        converts or followers were challenged to deny the statement. Both the 
        date and the name of the paper I have forgotten. Possibly, in your own 
        file of the <I>Reporter,</I> some notice of the matter may be found to 
        verify my recollection. <BR><BR>Many changes have occurred in old "Cat 
        Fish's Camp," as well as in Amity, since I first knew them. Mr. Joseph 
        Miller, Sr., is I presume, my old friend Jo Miller, with whom, in about 
        1815, I had many a game of house-ball, at the East side of Spalding's 
        tavern. If so and this article meets his eye, he will [recollect] the 
        stripling who sold tape and other necessaries in the frame house, nearly 
        opposite old Ziba Cook's residence, in Amity. He was then in the prime 
        of life; always in good humor; told a story well; a good shot with a 
        rifle; and the best ball-player in the crowd. When he and I happened to 
        be partners, we were sure to win. I wish him many happy days in a green 
        old age -- <BR><BR>If any of these desultory recollections of the olden 
        time can aid, in any way, the truth of history and the suppression of a 
        miserable [imposture], use them as you deem proper, either in print or 
        in the waste basket. <BR>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>We copy the following extraordinary communication from the 
        Washington (Pa.) <I>Review and Examiner</I> of the 10th inst. It throws 
        some light upon a matter that is everyday engrossing more of personal 
        and national: <BR><BR><SMALL><I>Messrs. Swan &amp; Ecker:</I> Being in 
        Amity a few days ago, in company with a friend, I visited the cemetery 
        belonging to the Presbyterian church in that village. The last resting 
        places of several individuals were pointed out, and specially attracted 
        my attention. The first, marked by a plain and substantial tombstone, 
        was that of the Rev. Thaddeus Dodd, who settled at Ten Mile in 1779, and 
        was doubtless the first minister of this church. He was the first 
        Principal of the Washington Academy, incorporated by the Legislature of 
        Pennsylvania on September 24, 1787, and merged into Washington College 
        in 1800. He was the father of the Rev. Cephas Dodd, who for many years 
        ministered to the people, both as a preacher and physician. His remains 
        also rest in this cemetery, and are marked by monumental grave stones 
        highly creditable to the workman, as well as honorable to the liberality 
        of friends. <BR><BR>The other was that of the Rev. (if he is worthy of 
        such a title) Solomon Spalding -- a name that has been somewhat 
        identified with the origin of Mormonism. Nothing remains to designate 
        the spot but a rapidly crumbling foot stone, with the initials "S. S.," 
        scarcely discernable. All that is left of the headstone is a very small 
        heap of scaly fragments. I was informed that a few years ago an attempt 
        was made, in that locality, to procure some money, by public 
        subscription, for the purpose of erecting at the grave durable and 
        respectable grave stones. The attempt failed, as I understood, on 
        account of a general feeling that the memory of such men should rot with 
        their bodies. <BR><BR>Rev. J. W. Hamilton, the present pastor of the 
        church, kindly furnished me with the following testimonials, which will 
        throw some light on what Spalding had to do with Mormonism. &nbsp;M.

        other reason the manjscripts remained unpublished for some time; and it 
        is alleged that the celebrated Sidney Rigdon, a former citizen of 
        Allegheny county, who joined in the Mormon movement, by some means got 
        possession of the tale or dream of poor Spalding, and together with Joe, 
        Smith, conjured out of it the most original and infamous religion of the

      <BLOCKQUOTE>...Sidney Rigdon, when quite a boy, living with his father 
        some fifteen miles south of Pittsburgh on a farm, was thrown from his 
        horse, his foot entangled in a stirrup and dragged some distance before 
        relieved. In this accident he received such a contusion of the brain as 
        ever after seriously to affect his character and in some respects, his 
        conduct. In fact, his brother always considered Sidney a little deranged 
        in his mind by that accident. His mental powers did hot seem to be 
        impaired, but the equlibrium in his intellectual exertions seemed 
        thereby to have been sadly affected. He still manifested great mental 
        activity and power, but he was to an equal degree inclined to run into 
        wild and visionary views on almost every question. Hence he was a fit 
        subject for any new movement in the religious world... <BR><FONT

      </P></FONT><FONT size=3 face=Times>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>On Friday last there died at Friendship, Allegany county, N. 
        Y., Sidney Rigdon, in the eighty-fourth year of his age. <BR><BR>He was 
        a person who had a peculiar history, and one not without interest to 
        Pittsburghers. He was born near Piney Fork, this county, and reached 
        maturity near the place of his birth. When about twenty-five years old, 
        he entered the ministry in the Baptist Church, and was for some time 
        pastor at the First Baptist Church, corner of Third and Grant streets. 
        Becoming dissatisfied with the faith, he with Alexander Campbell and a 
        Mr. Church, of this city formed the "Campbellite" or "Christian" church, 
        which at one time had a considerable number of adherents in this section 
        of the country. <BR><BR>Some time after he went to Ohio and organized a 
        congregation according to the new faith. There he met Elder Parley 
        Pratt, of the Mormon church, in debate, and becoming worsted joined the 
        Mormons and took his congregation with him. They went to Courtland [sic 
        - Kirtland?], Ohio, where a Mormon congregation was organized. From that 
        they were forced to go to Western Missouri, and, finally, by 
        persecutions were driven to Nauvoo. There Mr. Rigdon staid until within 
        six or seven months of Joe Smith's death, when, becoming dissatisfied 
        with polygamy, he returned to Pittsburgh. Hearing of Smith's death, and 
        that he was appointed his successor, Mr. Rigdon returned to Nauvoo. On 
        the day appointed for choosing Smith's successor, Mr. Rigdon told the 
        congregation that, if he was elected he would not only prohibit 
        polygamy, but expel every one who practiced it. He then asked the 
        audience if they desired to have him for President that each man hold up 
        his right hand. Not a hand was raised. Brigham Young then told the 
        audience that he was Smith's successor, and if elected he would carry 
        out his ideas. He was unanimously elected. <BR><BR>Mr. Rigdon again 
        returned to Pittsburgh, and tried to establish a church. Not succeeding 
        he moved to the Genesee Valley, N. Y., and has there remained up to the 
        time of his death, a period of about thirty years. After abandoning his 
        religious ventures he devoted himself to the study of geology, and 
        supported himself in a great measure by lecturing upon that science. He 
        is said to have been much respected in his community, as a law-abiding, 
        conscientious citizen. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note: This

      &nbsp;MORMONISM.</I></BIG> <BR><BR><SMALL>DEATH OF SIDNEY &nbsp;RIGDON -- 
      HIS CONNECTION<BR>WITH THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE MORMONS.</SMALL></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The early history of Mormonism is intimately blended with 
        the history of this county and of Western Pennsylvania, the <I>Book of 
        Mormon --</I> the bible of the polygamists -- having been printed in 
        this city, and two of the most noted founders of the "twin relic" having 
        had "a local habitation and a name" in our midst. Solomon Spalding, the 
        author of the <I>Book of Mormon,</I> lived in this city from 1812 to 
        1814, when he removed to Amity, Washington County, where he died and was 
        buried. Sidney Rigdon, who died in Friendship, Alleghany County, N. Y., 
        on Friday last, was born in St. Clair Township, this county, Feb. 19, 
        1793. The manuscript of the <I>Book of Mormon</I> was set up in a 
        printing office in Pittsburg in 1812, with which young Rigdon was 
        connected. Soon after getting possession of a copy of Spalding's 
        manuscript he left the printing office and became a preacher of 
        doctrines peculiar to himself and very similar to those afterward 
        incorporated into the <I>Book of Mormon.</I> He gained a small number of 
        converts to his views, when about 1829 he became associated with Joseph 
        Smith. It is asserted that through Rigdon's agency Smith became 
        possessed of a copy of Spalding's manuscript. Smith and Rigdon then set 
        about to establish a Church having at first vague and confused ideas as 
        to its nature and design, but with the <I>Book of Mormon</I> as their 
        text and authority, they began to preach this new gospel; and Smith's 
        family and a few of his associates, together with some of Rigdon's 
        followers, were soon numerous enough to constitute the Mormon Church, as 
        it was styled by the people around them, or the Latter Day Saints, as 
        they presently began to call themselves. The Church was organized in 
        Manchester, New York, in 1830. <BR><BR>The following year the believers 
        were led by Smith and Rigdon to Kirtland, Ohio, which was to be the seat 
        of the New Jerusalem. Here converts were rapidly made, and Smith and 
        Rigdon established a mill and store, and set up a bank without a 
        charter, of which Smith appointed himself President and made Rigdon 
        cashier. The neighboring country was flooded with notes of a very 
        doubtful value, and in consequence of this and other business 
        transactions, in which Smith and Rigdon were accused of fraudulent 
        dealing, a mob, on the night of March 22, 1832, dragged the two prophets 
        from their beds and tarred and feathered them. About a year afterward a 
        government for the Church was instituted, consisting of three 
        Presidents, Smith, Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, who together were 
        styled the First Presidency, a revelation from the Lord having declared 
        that the sins of Rigdon and Williams were forgiven, and that "they were 
        henceforth to be accounted as equal with Smith in holding the keys of 
        His kingdom." <BR><BR>In January, 1838, the bank at Kirtland having 
        failed, Smith and Rigdon, to avoid arrest for fraud fled in the night, 
        pursued by their creditors, and took refuge in Missouri. The Mormons 
        soon became involved in quarrels with the Missourians, and toward the 
        close of 1838 the conflict assumed the character and proportions of 
        civil war. The Militia of the State was called out, and Rigdon and Smith 
        were charged with treason, murder, and felony. Rigdon was released on a 
        habeas corpus. Shirtly after this Rigdon and Smith established 
        themselves in Illinois and built the City of Nauvoo. <BR><BR>After the 
        death of Joe Smith, Sidney Rigdon aspired to succeed him as head of the 
        Church, but Brigham Young was chosen First President, and Rigdon being 
        contumacious, was cut off from the faithful, cursed, and solemnly 
        delivered to the devil "to be duffeted in the flesh for a thousand 
        years." Having thus been turned out of the fold, Mr. Rigdon returned to 
        Pittsburg and tried to establish a church. Not succeeding, he moved to 
        the Genesee Valley, New York, and has there remained up to the time of 
        his death, a period of about thirty years. After abandoning his 
        religious ventures, he devoted himself to the study of geology and 
        supported himself in a great measure by lecturing upon that subject. He 
        was in the eighty-fourth year of his age, and is said to have been 
        highly respected by his neighbors during the declining years of his 
        life. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note 1: This obituary

        18, 1876</A>. <BR><BR>Note 2: The following article is from an 
        unidentified Pittsburgh newspaper of about the same date: 
        <SMALL>"[...one of the founders] of the Mormon church, Sidney Rigdon, 
        died last week in Allegany county, N . Y., aged eighty-four. The 
        deceased was formerly a printer, and carried on business in this city. 
        He was born in St. Clair township, this county, on the 19th of February, 
        1794. In 1812 Solomon Spaulding, the author of the original Mormon 
        bible, who resided, and is interred, in Washington county, put the 
        manuscript in the office in which Rigdon was at work, for publication. 
        Rigdon made a copy of the manuscript. After Rigdon had quitted the 
        printing business he became a Baptist preacher, and for a time was 
        pastor of the First Baptist church at Third avenue and Grant street. 
        Becoming dissatisfied with the faith, he with Alexander Campbell and a 
        Mr. Church, of this city, formed the "Campbellite" or "Christian" 
        Church, which at one time had a considerable number of adherents in this 
        section of the country. Some time afterward he went to Ohio and 
        organized a congregation according to the new faith. While there he met 
        Elder Parley Pratt, of the Mormun church, in debate, and becoming 
        worsted joined the Mormon Church, and took his congregation with him. 
        They went to Courtland [sic], Ohio, where a Mormon congregation was 
        organized. From thore they were forced to go to western Missouri, and 
        finally by persecutions were driven to Nauvoo. There Mr. Rigdon staid 
        until within six or seven months of Joe Smith's death, when, becoming 
        dissatisfied with polygamy; he returned to Pittsburg. Hearing of Smith's 
        death, and that he was appointed his successor, Mr. Rigdon returned to 
        Nauvoo. On tbe day appointed for choosing Smith's successor, Mr. Rigdon 
        told the congregation that if he was elected he would not only prohibit 
        polygamy, but expel every one who practiced it. He then asked the

        the Gonessee valley, N. Y., and there remained up to the time of his 
        death, a period of about thirty, years. After abandoning his religious

        Sydney Rigdon</A>. Rigdon was a curious genius, more knave than fool. I 
        will never forget the first and only time that I was ever in his 
        company. A friend had purchased a farm upon Sugar Creek, Crawford 
        county, who wished me to go up to Meadville for him, and have the title 
        examined, and if all right, to make the first payment upon it. This was 
        about the middle of March, 1836. While in Meadville flaming posters were 
        placed all over the town stating that at a certain hour, at the Court 
        House, Sydney Rigdon would deliver a discourse upon Mormonism and how 
        Joe Smith became the Mormon prophet. Upon arriving at the Court House, I 
        found myself somewhat late, as Mr. Rigdon was upon his feet and 
        speaking. The audience was large, and he was telling it a wonderful 
        rigmarole of an eagle arising in the East and flying to the West, and of 
        the [rod] of Ephraim breaking the staff of Jacob, &amp;c., when the 
        people got restless and broke in with, "Mr. Rigdon, we want to hear all 
        about the Mormon bible, and where Joe Smith got it." <BR><BR>This call 
        brought Sydney to a stand still, when he said: "Well, I will tell you 
        all about it. Joe Smith some few years previous was a poor boy who, to 
        earn a living, herded cattle in Ontario county, New York. He was a good 
        boy, and one day while herding cattle he fell into a trance, when the 
        angel Gabriel appeared to him and told him that he was the chosen of 
        God, appointed to be His prophet to reveal mysteries to the world that 
        had been kept hidden to the present time, and for him to go to a 
        particular spot, which he designated and dig, that he would there find a 
        revelation from God, which he was to proclaim to the world. Joe, when he 
        awoke, was so forcibly impressed with the heavenly vision that he 
        started off directly for a mattock and shovel, and went to work at the 
        place. After getting down about waist deep Joe came to a nice square 
        stone box. The four sides and bottom were each eighteen inches square. 
        The top was wider, projecting an inch or so over the sides, so as to 
        throw off water. In the center was a large iron ring into which a man 
        could comfortably put his hand. After clearing out all the earth from 
        around it, Joe laid hold of the ring to pull it out and get it up; but 
        there was no moving it. Joe tugged and tugged and tugged (his exact 
        words) but move it wouldn't. When he raised himself up out of the hole 
        and threw himself down upon his face to wonder over its stubbornness, 
        the fact came to his remembrance that the angel told him that he was to 
        take up the box when he was exactly twenty-one years of age, and that 
        that day he was only twenty. So Joe turned to and filled up the hole and 
        carried back his shovel and hoe and waited another year with great 
        patience, until the eventful hour arrived when he returned in full faith 
        that he was no[w] to receive a crown of rejoicing. The earth was again 
        taken out of the hole, the box cleared off, and he again laid hold of 
        the ring, when (with a graceful wave of his right hand, making a circle 
        in the air, bringing it down past his face to his left side), it just 
        came up like that." <BR><BR>When the box was once safe upon deck every 
        one then was anxious to hear what was in it, when we were told that it 
        contained fourteen gold plates, covered with mysterious characters, 
        together with the sword of Gideon and the spectacles of Samuel the 
        prophet! Joe, he said, was a very illiterate man, was unable either to 
        read or write; but when he put on his nose the prophet's spectacles, and 
        took the gold plates one by one, letter by letter and word by word 
        presented themselves, and with the aid of an amanuensis the Bible that 
        he held in his hand was a literal translation of the writing upon the 
        gold plates.<A name=pg3c5d>&nbsp;</A> <BR><BR>As a good many were 
        putting questions to Sydney, the writer's question to him was, "Had 
        <I>he</I> seen the contents of the mysterious box, and what kind of a 
        sword was it that could be packed away in an eighteen inch box?" But 
        Sydney had seen nothing. "But here," he said, turning to the back of the 
        Bible, "are the sworn statements of those who have seen it." To the 
        question, "What eventually became of the box?" we were told that Joe, 
        after having had the mysteries that he was to proclaim translated into 
        English, packed away everything again in the box and put it back where 
        he got it. <BR><BR>As the programme stated that Sydney, like the 
        Apostles of old, was to address us "in tongues," at this stage of the 
        proceedings a sharp, little man to my right, in spectacles, who, I was 
        afterwards told, was a Professor in Allegheny College, said, "Mr Rigdon, 
        I believe you to be a good German and Greek scholar, and after you have 
        spoken to us in those languages, I want you to speak to us in five or 
        six other languages, giving a list of them." This proposition was a 
        stumper which closed up poor Sydney, who, after looking all around him, 
        declared us to be such a set of unbelievers that he wouldn't open his 
        mouth to us again that day, and he sat down with his head upon his 
        breast. Then a lawyer to my left, said to be called Potter, put his hand 
        in his coat tail pocket and brought out a handful of shelled corn, which 
        he flung all around Sydney's head and shoulders, but Sydney neither 
        looked up nor moved. An old gentleman with a small Bible in his hand, 
        called Col. Cochran, here arose, and after a word to the audience, 
        pitched into Sydney. "To think," he said, "that a man who had once been 
        a minister of God joining with an imposter to delude the simple and 
        weakminded that he might be a big and looked up to man among them, is 
        horrible!" <BR><BR>Sydney bore a long, excoriating address without ever 
        looking up or speaking. I left him surrounded by a volunteer guard, who 
        promised to see him off without letting him be mobbed. As Brigham Young 
        has had a great many "latter day revelations," I thought that I would 
        give you Joseph Smith's first one, as told by Sydney Rigdon. <BR>&nbsp;

      <P align=center><B><BIG>How to Solve the Mormon Problem</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>... The only way -- is for the U. S. government to help 
        Joseph Smith Jr., the son of the prophet, to assert his leadership and 
        establish himself in the very Lion-house of the usurper, Brigham. In 
        making this suggestion, the other day, we pointed out that young Joseph 
        is <I>the legitimate successor of his father, nominated by 
        inspiration</I> for the office and <I>duly ordained,</I> that the 
        Mormons themselves confess the fact, admit that Brigham tricked the 
        Smith boys out of their rights, &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* and that they 
        have always looked on young Joseph with respect and even with reverence 
        &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* When Joseph visited Salt Lake City, he was 
        treated with the highest respect by the people, nor was it denied by any 
        one that he was the true high priest, prophet and revelator, and would 
        some day come back to rule over the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day 
        Saints. <BR><BR>Well, with the death of Brigham that day has arrived if 
        young Joseph has the pluck to assert himself. &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* In 
        this juncture the advent of a genuine leader, the legitimate successor, 
        claiming inspiration, and able to cry, "thus saith the Lord," to a 
        people who believe he has the right, would have a profound and decisive 
        effect, Coming as he would with an accession of adherents to swell the 
        Mormon body and heal a division of thirty years' standing, he ought 
        surely to succeed, if he exhibits half the ability and worldly wisdom of 
        his father. &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* The capture of the Utah Mormons by 
        Joseph Smith of Illinois <I>would insure the downfall of poligamy, and 
        this would be the elimination of the only feature of Mormonism to which 
        the United States has any objection. The Josephites of Illinois, of 
        Iowa, of Pittsburg, are as good and law abiding citizens as the members 
        of any other denomination, and possess no social customs that keep them 
        separate from the rest of the world.</I> With Joseph Smith ruling the 
        Mormon church, Utah would be as open to outside settlement as any other 
        territory. &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp;* It might prove a very brilliant act 
        of statesmanship for President Hayes to appoint Joseph Smith, Jr., 
        governor of Utah, and thus give him the vantage from which he might 
        conquer the place his father bequeathed him, and peacefully and lawfully 
        root out that relic of barbarism -- poligamy -- from the only spot in 
        the United States where it flourishes." "Let it (the government) keep 
        sternly on in the good work of punishing the Mountain Meadows murders...

      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>Major Gilbert of Palmyra, Missouri [sic. N.Y], gives 
        the following account of the getting up of the Mormon bible: One 
        pleasant day in the summer of 1829, Hiram Smith, Joe's brother, came to 
        the office to negotiate, for the printing of a book. The arrangements 
        were completed. Five thousand copies of the book were to be printed for 
        $3,000. A well-to-do farmer named Martin Harris, living in the 
        neighborhood, agreed to become security for the payment of the money, 
        and the work was at once put in hand. Major Gilbert set up all the type 
        of the book, except some 20 or 30 pages, and did nearly all the press 
        work. It was all worked off on a hand press. The copy was brought to the 
        office by Hiram Smith. It was written on foolscap paper in a good, clear 
        hand. The handwritimg was Oliver Cowdery's. There was not a punctuation 
        mark in the whole manuscript. The sentences were all run in without 
        capitals, or other marks to designate where one left off and another 
        began, and it was no easy task to straighten out the stuff. Major 
        Gilbert, perceiving that large portions were stolen verbatim from the 
        Bible, used to have a copy of that book on his case to aid him in 
        deciphering the manuscript and putting in the proper punctuation marks. 
        At first Smith used to come to the office every morning with just enough 
        manuscript to last through the day. But it was so much bother to put in 
        the punctuation that Gilbert said; "Bring me around a quantity copy at a 
        time, and I can go through it and fix it up evenings, and so get along 
        faster with it." Smith replied: "This is pretty important business young 
        man, and I don't know as we can trust this manuscript in your 
        possession." Finally his scruples were overcome, and he consented to 
        this arrangement. Then he would bring around a quire of paper, or 48 
        pages, at a time, and this would last several days. When the matter had 
        been set all the copy was carefully taken away again by Smith. It took 
        eight months to set up the book and run it through the press. Major 
        Gilbert was not much interested in the book, thought it rather dry and 
        prosy, and to this day has never thought it worth his while to read it a 
        second time. Of course, nobody then dreamed that the "Book of Mormon" 
        was destined to achieve the notority which it has gained, or that it was 
        to cut such a figure in the history of this country. It did not find a 
        very ready sale, at the outset, and Harris, who had mortgaged his farm 
        to pay the printer's bill, was cleaned out financially; He was an 
        intimate friend of the Smiths, and afterwards became an adherent to the 
        doctrines they taught. He did not follow them Westward, however, but 
        remained near his own home, where he died two years ago. With this book 
        as the basis of his teaching, Joe Smith began to preach, and soon formed 
        a congregation of followers in Palmyra and the neighboring village of 
        Manchester, where the Smiths resided. A year later, he, with thirty of 
        his followers removed to Kirtland, Ohio. His subsequent history is well 
        known. There were nine children in the Smith family. Joe was then about 
        23 years of age. He was a lazy, good-for-nothing lout, chiefly noted for 
        his capacity to hang around a corner grocery and punish poor whisky. He 
        had good physical strength, but he never put it to any use in the way of 
        mowing grass or sawing wood. He could wrestle pretty well, but was not 
        given to exerting his muscles in any practical way. He had evidently 
        made up his mind that there was an easier way of getting a living than 
        by honest industry. He was the discoverer of a magic stone which he used 
        to carry around in his hat. Holding it carefully laid in the bottom of 
        his hat he would bring his eye to bear on it at an angle of about 45 
        degrees and forthwith discover the whereabouts of hidden treasures. He 
        would draw a circle on the ground and say to the awe struck bystanders, 
        "dig deep enough within this circle and you will find a pot of gold." 
        But he never dug himself. He had a good share of the rising generation 
        of Palmyra out digging in the suburbs, and to this day traces of the 
        pits thus dug are pointed out to curious visitors. As he claimed to be 
        the author of the "Book of Mormon" his story was that by the aid of his 
        wonderful stone he found gold plates on which were inscribed the 
        writings in hieroglyphics. He translated them by means of a pair of 
        magic spectacles which the Lord delivered to him at the same time that 
        the golden tablets were turned up. But nobody but Joe himself ever saw 
        the golden tablets or the far-seeing spectacles. He dictated the book, 
        concealed behind a curtain, and it was written down by Cowdery. This 
        course seemed to be rendered necessary by the fact that Joe did not know 
        how to write. Otherwise the book might have gone to the printer in the 
        handwriting of Old Mormon himself. It is now pretty well established 
        that the "Book of Mormon" was written in 1812 by the Rev. Solomon 
        Spalding. of Ohio, as a popular romance. He could not find anyone to 
        print it. The manuscript was sent to Pittsburg, where it lay in a 
        printing-office several years. Spalding was never able to raise the 
        money to secure the printing of the story, and after his death in 1824 
        [sic - 1816] it was returned to his wife. By some means, exactly how is 
        not known, it fell into the hands of one Sidney Rigdon, who, with Joe 
        Smith, concocted the scheme by which it was subsequently brought out as 
        the work of Smith. The dealings with the outside world in respect to it 
        were manipulated by Hiram Smith, an elder brother of Joe.

      <P align=center><B><BIG>POLYGAMY &nbsp;AND &nbsp;THE 
      &nbsp;CONSTITUTION.</BIG></B> 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The decision of the U. S. Supreme Court, rendered on the 6th 
        inst. and briefly reported in last week's B<SMALL>ANNER</SMALL>, 
        deserves more than a passing reference which was all we could then give 
        it. Like most other evils, polygamy dies hard, and its death struggle is 
        not over. A great point, however, has been gained in the fact that the 
        Third District Court of Utah, in whose jurisdiction this test case 
        originated, and on appeal the Supreme Court of Utah Territory, and on 
        further appeal the Supreme Court of the United States have all decided, 
        as indeed would seem to have been inevitable, that the law of Congress, 
        enacted in 1862, prohibiting bigamy in the Territories, is 
        constitutional. This law provided that "every person having a husband or 
        wife living, who marries another, whether married or single, in a 
        Territory or other place over which the United States have exclusive 
        jurisdiction, is guilty of bigamy, and shall be punished by a fine of 
        not more than $500, and shall be imprisoned for a term of not more than 
        five years." In this statute nothing is said of polygamy, or, as the 
        Mormons designate it, "plural marriage;" but as, according to other 
        precedents, the "plural" husband may be punished for each offence, the 
        subject must be one of peculiar interest in Utah just now for those 
        miscreants who have "pluraled" from ten to twenty times. <BR><BR>It only 
        remains that so righteous a law should be rigorously and impartially 
        enforced, and this foul blot upon our national honor will soon be 
        removed. For twenty years these culprits have defied the laws and 
        authority of the United States, and have added to their licentiousness 
        uncounted acts of violence and cruelty. Some of the most revolting 
        murders have been indubitably fastened upon the Mormon leaders, as in 
        the noted case of the Mountain Meadow massacre. The wretched plea of 
        "religious requirement" as a cover for their crimes, but renders them 
        more revolting. Possibly another Mormon exodus may result from this 
        decision of the Supreme Court, and some unfortunate Mexican province may 
        be the next theatre for the display of their so-called religion. But if 
        they remain upon American soil, they should be compelled to obey 
        American laws or suffer the penalties of their infraction. <BR><FONT 
        color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note 1: Publicity given the U. S. Supreme 
        Court's 1879 positive decision on the legality of the "bigamy" law 
        quickly placed the "Mormon Question" back on the front pages of American 
        newspapers, including those in Pennsylvania. For ten years the momentum 
        had been building among the non-Mormon easterners to do something about 
        this "question." With the completion of the railroad through Utah, the 
        death of Brigham Young, and the political irritation generated by the 
        Utahans continued push for statehood, it was inevitable that the legal, 
        religious and political situation of the Mormons would be thrown back 
        into the pages of the popular press in a major way at the end of the 
        1870s. The Supreme Court's decision was the spark that ignited a ten 
        year blaze of news articles on the Mormons in American papers. 
        <BR><BR>Note 2: While most American newspapers of the period confined 
        their reporting on this topic to matters closely related to the battle 
        over Mormon polygamy, the papers of the Pittsburgh area contributed 
        numerous secondary reports on relevant historical figures like Sidney 
        Rigdon and Solomon Spalding, both of whom had once lived in the city. It 
        was this batch of 1879 Pennsylvania news articles, coupled with the 
        several <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/UT/tribune1.htm#021479">related 
        articles</A> written by James T. Cobb for the <I>Salt Lake Tribune</I> 
        during 1879 that brought the Spalding authorship matter back before the 
        public attention and resulted in several interesting developments in the 
        "Spalding theory" during the early and mid 1880s. See, for example, the 
        effect of Cobb's research in the <A

      <P align=center><B><BIG>Origin of Mormonism.<BR>_____</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>For the Reporter. <BR></SMALL><BR>(Dr. W. W. Sharp, 
        of Amity, this county, has prepared a statement concerning early 
        Mormonism, for James T. Cobb, Esq., of Salt Lake City, which he has 
        kindly placed in our hands for publication, as follows:) <BR><BR><BR>In 
        view of the magnitude of the Mormon delusion, and of the serious 
        complications it is likely to cause in the near future, by its relations 
        to our government, every thing conected with its origin and history, 
        challenges an almost universal interest. <BR><BR>The author of the 
        "Manuscript Found," which doubtless suggested the Book of Mormon, and 
        occupied so important a position in its conception, design and 
        execution, lived and died in Amity, Pa. The old frame house he occupied 
        is still tenable, and his grave in the old cemetery attracts many a 
        curious visitor. A stone still marks the foot of the grave with one of 
        its bold initials obliterated. Time has reduced the headstone to small 
        particles of dust, while many a fragment of it adorns the cabinets of 
        the antiquarians. About eighteen years ago, the writer, by carefully 
        replacing the broken pieces, obtained a fragmentary copy of its 
        inscription, a part of which was a four-line stanza, commencing as 
        follows: <BR><BR>
        <DIR>
        <DIR>"A seraph tuned his sweetest lay." </DIR></DIR>But we have a living 
        witness -- Joseph Miller -- a veteran of the war of 1812. A Christian 
        gentleman of undoubted veracity, with mind and memory remarkable for 
        their prolonged preservation, and singularly free from any signs of 
        senility. I had an interview with Mr. Miller two days ago. Found him 
        well and hearty barring some muscular disability, and as ready to crack 
        a joke or fling a repartee as ever. He said, if he lived till to-day, 
        (Feb. 1) he would be 88 years old. <BR><BR>I asked him to give me all 
        the information he could from his personal knowledge of Rev. Solomon 
        Spaulding and his family, his recollections and impressions, from 
        association with him, with reference especially to his object in writing 
        the "manuscript found," and its subsequent misuse by the founders of the 
        Mormon sect. Prefacing his reply with the remark that he would not 
        intentionally say one word that he did not believe to be strictly true; 
        he proceeded deliberately, to make in substance, the following 
        statement: <BR><BR><BR><SMALL>I was well acquainted with Mr. Spaulding 
        while he lived in Amity, Pa. I would say he was 55 to 60 years of age; 
        in person, tall and spare, and considerably stooped, caused in part, I 
        think, from a severe rupture. His hair was quite gray. He was chaste in 
        language and dignified in manner, becoming his profession. I never heard 
        him preach, think he never preached at A.; said he had quit preaching on 
        account of ill health. He kept a public house or tavern of the character 
        common at that day. He died of dysentery in 1816, (in the fall, I 
        think), after an illness of six or eight weeks. Dr. Chephas Dodd 
        attended him. <BR><BR>I watched with him many nights during this 
        illness. After he died I made his coffin and superintended his burial. 
        One night when near his end, he told me he thought he should die, and 
        requested me to assist his wife in settling his estate; accordingly I, 
        with Col. Thomas Venom went on her bond as administratrix, and I helped 
        her close it up. <BR><BR>Mrs. Spaulding was intelligent and of pleasing 
        manners, with fair complexion, and say, from 35 to 40 years of age. 
        <BR><BR>A child of fair complexion and about 14 years of age, lived with 
        them here, think she was their daughter as she bore the Spaulding name. 
        <BR><BR>Mr. S. was poor but honest. I endorsed for him twice to borrow 
        money. His house was a place of common resort especially in the evening. 
        I was prosecuting my trade (carpenter) in the village and frequented his 
        house. Mr. S. seemed to take delight in reading from his manuscript 
        (written on foolscap) for the entertainment of his frequent visitors, 
        heard him read most, if not all of it, and had frequent conversations 
        with him about it. <BR><BR>Sometime ago, I had in my possession, for 
        about six months, the book of Mormon and heard most of it read during 
        the time. I was always forcibly struck with the similarity of the 
        portions of it which purported to be of supernatural origin to the 
        quaint style and peculiar language that had made so deep an impression 
        on my mind when hearing the manuscript read by Mr. S. For instance, the 
        very frequent repetition of the phrase, "and it came to pass." Then on 
        hearing read the account from the book of the battle between the 
        Amalekites and the Nephites, in which the soldiers of one army had 
        placed a red mark on their foreheads to distinguish them from their 
        enemies, it seemed to reproduce in my mind not only the narrative, but 
        the very words as they had been impressed on my mind by the reading of 
        Spaulding's manuscript. <BR><BR>The object of Mr. S. in writing the 
        manuscript found as I understood, was to employ an invalid's lovely 
        imagination, and to supply a romantic history of those last [sic, lost?] 
        races or tribes, whose true history remains buried with their dust 
        beneath those mysterious mounds, so common in a large portion of our 
        country. <BR><BR>Its publication seemed to be an after thought, most 
        likely suggested by pecuniary embarrassment. My recollection is that Mr. 
        S. had left a transcript of the manuscript with Mr. Patterson, of 
        Pittsburgh, Pa., for publication, that its publication was delayed until 
        Mr. S. would write a preface, and in the mean time the transcript was 
        spirited away and could not be found. Mr. S. told me that Sidney Rigdon 
        had taken it, or that he was suspicioned for it. Recollect distinctly 
        that Rigdon's name was used in that connection. <BR><BR>The longer I 
        live the more firmly I am convinced that Spaulding's MS. was 
        appropriated and largely used in getting up the Book of Mormon. I 
        believe, that leaving out of the book the portion that may be easily 
        recognised as the work of Joe Smith and his accomplices that Solomon 
        Spaulding may be truly said to be its author. I have not a doubt of it. 
        <BR><BR>If my life has been prolonged, that I might assist in exposing 
        so base a fraud, and if I shall be permitted to see this abominable 
        delusion dispelled, I shall console myself with the thought that I have 
        not lived in vain. <BR></SMALL><BR>At the close of the interview I dined 
        with my old life long friend, (we call him uncle Joe) and after a few 
        parting words I was on my way home feeling that it is seldom one enjoys 
        so much pleasure and profit as I had in this interview. &nbsp; W. W.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>The little town of Amity, a few miles up the Monongahela 
        River, was the birth place of Mormonism. For many years Sidney Rigdon 
        was thought to have written the Book of Mormon, afterward elaborated by 
        Joe Smith, and made the basis of the faith or system of the Utah Colony, 
        but some investigations lately made at Amity by Dr. W. W, Sharp, under 
        authority from Salt Lake City, have brought out a new story about the 
        origin of the book. Dr. Sharp writes as follows to the <I>Reporter</I> 
        of Washington, Pa. <BR><BR><SMALL>The author of the "Manuscript Found," 
        which doubtless suggested the Book of Mormon, and occupied so important

          hearing the manuscript read by Mr. S. For instance, the very frequent 
          repetition of the phrase, "and it came to pass." Then on hearing read 
          the account from the book of the battle between the Amalekites and the 
          Nephites, in which the soldiers of one army had placed a red mark on 
          their foreheads to distinguish them from their enemies, it seemed to 
          reproduce in my mind not only the narrative, but the very words, as 
          they had been impressed on my mind by the reading of Spaulding's 
          manuscript. <BR><BR>The object of Mr. S. in writing the "Manuscript 
          Found," as I understood, was to employ an invalid's lonely 
          imagination, and to support a romantic history of those l[o]st races 
          or tribes, whose true history remains buried with their dust beneath 
          those mysterious mounds so common in a large portion of our country. 
          <BR><BR>Its publication seemed to be an afterthought, most likely 
          suggested by pecuniary embarrassment. My recollection is that Mr. S. 
          had left a transcript of the manuscript with Mr. Patterson, of 
          Pittsburgh, Pa., for publication, that its publication was delayed 
          until Mr. S. would write a preface, and in the meantime the transcript 
          was spirited away and could not be found. Mr. S. told me that Sidney 
          Rigdon had taken it, or that he was suspicioned for it. Recollect 
          distinctly that Rigdon's name was used in that connection. <BR><BR>The 
          longer I live the more firmly I am convinced that Spaulding's MS. was 
          appropriated and largely used in getting up the Book of Mormon. I 
          believe, that leaving out of the book the portion that may be easily 
          recognised as the work of Joe Smith and his accomplices, that Solomon 
          Spaulding may be truly said to be its author. I have not a doubt of 
          it. </BLOCKQUOTE></SMALL><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR>Note: This letter

      <P align=center><B><BIG>A &nbsp;QUESTION &nbsp;OF 
      &nbsp;AUTHORSHIP.</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>A correspondent of the Washington, Pa., <I>Reporter,</I> Dr. 
        W. W. Sharp, has given an interesting account of his attempt to 
        investigate the origin of the Book of Mormon. It is nothing less than 
        surprising to find able editors, even of city journals characterizing 
        Dr. Sharp's statement as "a new story about the origin of the book." As 
        we have said, the account is interesting, but its interest consists 
        wholly or chiefly in the fact that the writer repeats with apparent 
        fidelity the narrative of an aged though still competent witness 
        respecting facts often before related. That the book out of which the 
        Book of Mormon was concocted was the work of the Rev. Solomon Spaulding, 
        a Congregationalist clergyman, has been frequently asserted with the 
        allegation of evidence more or less satisfactory. Mr. Spaulding, 
        disqualified for his professional labors by ill health, spent the last 
        two years of his life in the village of Amity, in this State, where, it 
        seems, he kept a decent public house or tavern for subsistence. He died 
        in 1816, and Dr. Sharp has lately conversed with an old man, Mr. Miller, 
        who knew him well, and who retains a distinct recollection of the style 
        and general tenor of the manuscript which has been so often mentioned as 
        the source of the book of Mormon. The style of the manuscript which was 
        an imitation of the style of the King James version of the Bible, and 
        the tenor of it was a romantic history of those lost races or tribes who 
        formerly inhabited this country, and of whom the mysterious mounds of 
        the Mississippi valley are supposed to be the remains. Mr. Miller has 
        seen the Book of Mormon, and not only the style recalled the Spaulding 
        manuscript, but he at once recognized the tribal name of the Nephites as 
        a name used in the romance. Othervdetails proving the general identity 
        of the two books were attested years ago by other persons who knew 
        Spaulding and had read or heard his novel. <BR><BR>Spaulding no doubt 
        wrote the story merely for his own amusement, but the interest with 
        which his neighbors listened to the reading of it, or some cause, seems 
        to have raised in the hope of profit from its publication. At any rate, 
        there is no doubt that a copy of the manuscript was placed in the hands 
        of Mr. Paterson, of Pittsburg, for the purpose of being printed -- that 
        Sidney Rigdon, afterwards so closely associated with Joe Smith in the 
        promulgation of his pretended revelation, was on terms of intimacy with 
        Mr. Patterson -- and that the manuscript suddenly disappeared. Theree 
        must be several persons in the city of Pittsburgh able to say whether 
        these statements are correct, and it seems therefore worth while to 
        repeat them once more with the view of having them attested or denied. 
        We have already seen that the account of the Spaulding origin of the 
        Mormon book is not universally known. A great English writer, Mr. Stuart 
        Mills, has spoken of the rise and progress of Mormonism as perhaps the 
        most remarkable phenomena of the nineteenth century. Whether this be a 
        just estimate or not, there can be no question about the singular 
        curiosity which attaches to the subject. In the light they reflect upon 
        the operation of superstition in remote ages the facts are most 
        significant and instructive, while as mere illustrations of the 
        obscurities and difficulties which attend the historical investigation 
        of origins, both religious and national, Mormonism already offers 
        problems worthy of the most earnest attention. <BR><FONT color=maroon

      </SMALL></CENTER>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>To the Editor of the Telegraph.</I> <BR><BR>In your issue 
        of yesterday you published an article in relation to the "Book of 
        Mormon," in which the name of Sidney Rigdon naturally appeared. That man 
        was a popular preacher in his day. There are a few, and but a few, now 
        living, who were men and women in those days, and heard him preach. His 
        manner is just as fresh in my mind to-day, as when in my boyhood I heard 
        him preach in the old Baptist church, on the corner of Third and Grant 
        Streets. It was an old one-story frame building, standing on the spot 
        now occupied by the Universalist church. He must have been an 
        extraordinary man, for the house was always filled to hear him. He was 
        truly eloquent, and used the most elegant language, at least I thought 
        him certainly the best preacher in the city. He preached three times 
        every Sunday throughout the year, and such a thing as "hay fever" was a 
        disease unknown in all our orders. It is greatly to be regretted that 
        such a dreadful plague has of late years been afflicting our preachers, 
        many of them leaving their posts for rural scenes, and some of them 
        taking refuge in Europe from the attacks of the terrible scourge! It is 
        certain that then, as well as now: <BR><BR>
        <DIR>
        <DIR><SMALL>"Dangers stood thick through all the ground.<BR>&nbsp; To 
        push us to the tomb<BR>And fierce diseases waited round<BR>&nbsp; To 
        hurry mortals home." </DIR></DIR></SMALL>Yet they stood up like men and 
        soldiers, and faced the dangers, and if they found that any disease got 
        hold of them, they would leave the pulpit for the care and comfort of 
        their homes and struggle with the monster there, where their wives and 
        children could minister to their wants. How changed the times! 
        <BR><BR>Mr. Rigdon had at [that] time some difficulty with his church, 
        what it was I never knew; but whatever it was, he [left] the church for 
        a season. The people called him back again, and on the Sunday morning 
        following his return he preached from the following text. <BR><BR>"I 
        came unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for. I therefore 
        ask for what intent you have sent for me?" In the afternoon at 3 
        o'clock, from the text: "For I am determined to know nothing among you, 
        save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified," and in the evening: "Tell me, if 
        you will deal kindly and truly with my Master, and if not, tell me so 
        that I may turn to the right hand or to the left." <BR><BR>It is not far 
        from sixty years since these sermons were preached, and, to this day, I 
        picture the man in my memory, as he stood in the pulpit pouring forth 
        the strains of fervid eloquence to a house full to repletion, as if it 
        were only yesterday. <BR><BR>One Sunday he preached three sermons from 
        the following text (quoting from memory, I may not give the exact 
        language of scripture) "And in the days of these kings shall the God of 
        Heaven set up a kingdom that shall not be left to the hands of other 
        people, but it shall break in pieces all other kingdoms and shall stand 
        forever." No one ever tired under him, although he would preach more 
        than an hour. <BR><BR>After he turned Mormon it was supposed that he had 
        something of the kind in his mind when he preached from that text. Be 
        this as it may, they were three excellent sermons. I would like to know 
        how [many of those] living at this day heard him on [these] occasions? 
        Oh how many thousands are now sleeping in our "silent cities of the 
        dead" who were among the busy ones thronging our thoroughfares in the 
        days of Sidney Rigdon! <BR><BR>P<SMALL>ITTSBURGH</SMALL>, February 7, 
        1879. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note 1: The exact date of 
        this letter's publication remains uncertain. It may have been printed 
        the day before, or the day after Feb. 8, 1879. <BR><BR>Note 2: The First 
        Baptist Church of Pittsburgh began as a small congregation in 1812, the 
        same year Solomon Spalding arrived in that town. In 1820 the members 
        built a modest frame building at the corner of Third Avenue and Grant 
        Street. It was here that the Rev. Sidney Rigdon served his pastorate in 
        1822 and 1823. The present stone chapel was erected in 1867 at Fourth 
        Avenue and Grant Street. An extension was constructed in 1876, placing 
        the chapel's new front door on Ross Street, as it remains today. 
        <BR><BR>Note 3: It is interesting that the correspondent recalled Rigdon 
        preaching a proto-Mormon sermon in Pittsburgh as early as 1822-23. The 
        Rev. Samuel Williams reported also hearing that Rigdon was preaching an 
        early version of the Campbellites' adult immersion for the remission of 
        sins at about this same time. This tenet (still new and controversial 
        when introduced on a wide scale by Rev. Walter Scott in the fall of 
        1827) was a key teaching in the 1830 Book of Mormon.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>In another column will be seen what there is much reason to 
        believe is a true history of the origin of the Mormon Bible." It will be 
        read with the closest attention. <BR><BR>Polygamy was not one of the 
        original features of the delusion, but was afterwards engrafted upon it. 
        And to this day the Mormon emissaries in Europe are careful to conceal 
        their peculiar and distinct views with regard to marriage; otherwise 
        they would prevent their success in obtaining new recruits almost 
        altogether. It is only after their arrival in Utah that the greater part 
        of deceived Europeans learn how purity, law and decency have been set 
        aside in the matter of marriage, John Taylor, now President of the 
        Mormon Church, when in France in 1853, although he then had no less than 
        five wives, denied the existence of polygamy among the Mormons, and had 
        a denial printed in pamphlet form in French and circulated in large 
        numbers. Now this same John Taylor declares that the revelations 
        concerning polygamy came directly from heaven; that is his religion, and 
        neither Congress nor the Supreme Court of the United States which 
        declared the act of 1862 forbidding polygamous marriages in the 
        territories of the United States constitutional, will have no effect 
        except to unite, confirm and strengthen Mormons in their faith. And it 
        is well known that leading Mormons have taken additional wives since the 
        decision of the Supreme Court was given. In direct contempt of the 
        opinion of the court, John W. Young has married his fifth wife, James 
        Welch his second wife and John White his third wife. At the same time 
        Mormon women are beseiging the President and others in authority and 
        Delegate Cannon and representatives of the Mormon Church are petitioning 
        for amnesty and promising obedience to the law. <BR><BR>In view of the 
        state of things it is not strange that a petition has been addressed to 
        Congress by the anti-polygamists in Utah, praying that instead of 
        rendering the law against polygamy more lenient, Congress would amend 
        the act of 1862 by making living together in polygamy under the general 
        reputation of marriage sufficient to constitute the offence, as 
        otherwise the statyte will be practically inoperative. In this movement 
        the law-observing and purity-loving people of Utah should have the 
        co-operation of all opponents of the iniquitous institution, in all 
        parts of the country. Thorough work should be made in delivering the 
        people of the United States from the charge of tolerating a degrading 
        system of concubinage. Too much confidence must not be placed in 
        Congress, without watchfulness on the part of the people; its members 
        ought to be made to feel that the public eye is always upon them, and 
        they will be held to strict account for neglect of duty. <BR><BR>

        ALFRED CREIGH, LL., D.<BR>_____</SMALL> <BR></P>The recent decision of 
        the Supreme Court of the United States, sustaining the constitutionality 
        of the law of Congress, enacted in 1862, punishing bigamy in the 
        Territories with fine and imprisonment, has attracted public attention 
        anew to the most stupendous delusion of the nineteenth century. Thank 
        God for the decision! It is a step in the right direction to crush out a 
        system destructive of good morals, patriotism, the marriage relation and 
        the principles of liberty. <BR><BR>The facts in regard to the origin of 
        the Book of Mormon have been frequently published. They were detailed by 
        the present writer in his "History of Washington County," published <A 
        href="http://solomonspalding.com/Lib/Cre1870a.htm">in 1870</A>. Briefly 
        they are as follows: <BR><BR>Rev. Solomon Spaulding, a graduate of 
        Dartmouth College, became a resident of New Salem (sometimes called 
        Conneaut), in Ashtabula County, O., in the early part of the present 
        century. Here he was compelled by the state of his health to desist from 
        active labors. To occupy his hours of leisure, he amused himself by 
        writing a historical romance, containing a record of the wanderings and 
        the varied fortunes of the race that reared the mounds so numerous 
        throughout the West, and many of which were to se seen in the vicinity 
        of his residence. This was about the year 1812. The romance, purporting 
        to be written by one of the lost race and to have been recovered from 
        the earth, was entitled the "Manuscript Found." Mr. Spaulding, as his 
        work progressed, frequently read it to his neighbors, many of whom 
        became interested in it and familiar with the events and names recorded. 
        From New Salem Mr. Spaulding removed to Pittsburgh and deposited his 
        manuscript in the printing office of Mr. Patterson for examination, with 
        a view to publication. It is supposed that Sidney Rigdon, one of the 
        originators of the Mormon delusion, had come across this manuscript 
        whilst in the office, became acquainted with its contents, and possibly 
        made or obtained a copy of it. After some time the manuscript was 
        returned to Mr. Spaulding, who soon after removed to Amity, Washington 
        County, Pa., where he died in 1816. About 1830 the Book of Mormon 
        appeared; a Mormon preacher visited New Salem and in a public meeting 
        read copious extracts from the book, which were immediately recognized 
        by the older inhabitants present as the identical work of Mr. Spaulding; 
        and his brother, being present, arose on the spot and with tears 
        expressed his sorrow that the work of his sainted brother should be used 
        for so shocking a purpose. The inhabitants of New Salem held a meeting 
        and deputed one of their number, Dr. Hurlbut, to repair to Monson, 
        Mass., where Mr. Spaulding's widow (who had married a Mr. Davidson) 
        resided, to obtain the original manuscript for comparison with the 
        Mormon Bible. This was in 1834. Mrs. Davidson afterwards wrote a full <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NE/miscne01.htm#041939">statement 
        of the facts</A>, of which the above is but an outline. This statement 
        (given in full in the "Hist. of Wash. Co." pp. 91-93, was published in 
        1839, and elicited from Mr. Rigdon the year a published denial of all 
        knowledge on his part of Mr. Spaulding's manuscript. In connection with 
        Mrs. Davidson's statement, a letter from Joseph Miller, Sr., dated <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#040869">March 
        26, 1869</A>, is given in the "History above referred to. Mr. Miller 
        (still living at Amity, being 88 years of age) was well acquainted with 
        Mr. Spaulding, waited on him in his last illness and assisted at his 
        burial. Mr. Miller had heard Mr. Spaulding read portions of his novel 
        entitled the "Manuscript Found," and afterwards on hearing the Book of 
        Mormon read, recollected several passages as the same he had heard Mr. 
        Spaulding read. One passage he remembers distinctly, where the 
        Amalekites had marked themselves with red on the foreheads to 
        distinguish them from the Nephites. The singularity had fixed it in his 
        memory. <BR><BR>To the testimony of which the above is a brief sketch, 
        the following facts may be added as not devoid of interest in connection 
        with the history of this colosal fraud: <BR><BR><A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NE/miscne02.htm#090377">Mr. 
        McKinstry</A>, a son of the late Dr. McKinstry of Monson, Mass., and the 
        grandson of Rev. S. Spaulding, says that his grandmother came East from 
        Ohio to live with her daughter at Monson many years ago, bringing the 
        manuscript of his grandfather's romance with her. Before her death a 
        plausible young man from Boston came to see and get the Spaulding 
        writing. It was a time of considerable excitement concerning the 
        Mormons, and he claimed to represent some Christian people who wanted to 
        expose Mormonism. He therefore begged the loan of the manuscript for 
        publication. Much against the wishes of Mrs. Dr. McKinstry, the daughter 
        of Mrs. Spaulding (now Davidson) she consented to let her husband's 
        unpublished romance be taken away. Nothing was ever heard of it again, 
        and the family have always considered that the bland young gentleman was 
        an agent of Brigham Young to destroy this convincing evidence that Joe 
        Smith's Mormon Bible was of very earthly origin. <BR><BR>The widow of 
        Mr. Spaulding and her daughter, Mrs. Dr. McKinstry, had compared the 
        Mormon Bible with the romance of the "Manuscript Found," and stated that 
        they were essentially the same -- that the similarity was so 
        overwhelming as to leave no doubt on their minds but that Joe Smith or 
        Sidney Rigdon had copied it in full and made out of it bodily, the 
        divine revelation -- as a special revelation from God on plates of gold 
        engraven by his own hand -- and that after being translated they were 
        taken back to heaven. <BR><BR>The Springfield (Mass.) <I>Republican</I> 
        gives its testimony in these words: The story of how the Rev. Mr, 
        Spaulding came to prepare his romance, which Mr McKinstry remembers as a 
        child to have seen, is very interesting. Mr. Spaulding was out of the 
        active ministry in Ohio, and employed his leisure moments in weaving a 
        romance. It was at the time when the Mound Builders were creating wild 
        excitement and interest -- the implements of cookery and war being 
        unearthed showing the existence of a forgotten race. This furnished the 
        inspiration for the chronicles of the story writen. He entitled the 
        production the "Manuscript Found," the idea being that the romance 
        written by Mr. Spaulding was dug up out of one of the mounds in the 
        region. It was a history of Ancient America, not all written at once, 
        but as leisure and fancy occurred to him, Mr. Spaulding would add to it. 
        His writing was no secret in the neighborhood. In that then frontier 
        region, with few opportunities for literary enjoyment. Rev. Mr. 
        Spaulding was prevailed upon to read to his neighbors. It was written in 
        Bible phraseology and made as quaintly old as possible, so as to carry 
        out the idea of its alleged mound origin. <BR><BR>I might add in this 
        connection that Joe Smith was born on Vermont in 1805, and his friends 
        claim that when he was fifteen years of age he was informed by an angel 
        in a vision of the apostacy of the Primitive church. On September 22, 
        1827 he received from the hands of a messenger from the Lord the golden 
        plates containing the ancient history of this continent, written by 
        various prophets and concealed by Morni [sic] in the year 420. He was 
        informed that he was the chosen instrument to restore God's church to 
        its former purity and holiness. Accordingly he proceeded to translate 
        the golden plates and the church was organized in 1830. <BR><BR>Three 
        witnesses, viz: Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, testify 
        that an angel of God came down from heaven and he brought and laid 
        before our eyes that we beheld and saw the plates and the engraving 
        thereon;" and I may add, to complete the imposture, that Joe Smith 
        exhibited these plates to Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter 
        Whitmer, Jr., John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith, Sr., Hiram Smith 
        and Samuel H. Smith, and that they "had the appearance of gold and the 
        engraving was of curious eorkmanship and was handled by their own 
        hands." <BR><BR>We can readily account for the reason why the Whitmers 
        and the Smiths are the principal witnesses -- because the book itself 
        says that "Morni, a son of Mormon, was authorized to show the plates 
        unto those who shall assist to bring forth this work and unto 
        <I>three</I> shall they be shown (viz: Cowdery, Whitmer and Harris) by 
        the power of God wherefore they shall know of a surety that these things 
        are true." <BR><BR>Such is the stupendous fraud and imposture which has 
        been imposed not only on the American people, but upon foreign countries 
        to which emissaries have gone, bringing back ignorant people by the ship 
        load to become American citizens. <BR><FONT color=maroon

        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NE/miscne02.htm#090377">Sep. 
        3, 1877</A>. The same reprint was also carried by the <I>Syracuse 
        Journal</I> on that same date. Creigh's paraphrase of the McKinstry 
        statement changes the original wording considerably. Also, it should be 
        noted here that the 1877 McKinstry statement conflates the two separate 
        visits of D. P. Hurlbut (in 1833) and Jesse Haven (in 1839) into a 
        single, somewhat jumbled account. <BR><BR>Note 3: Rev. Robert Patterson, 
        Jr., the secondary "editor and proprietor" of the <I>Banner</I> Robert 
        Patterson, Jr., was at least marginally involved in investigations of 
        the Spalding claims as early as November of 1878, when the Rev. Samuel 
        Williams contacted Patterson about his father's contact with Spalding in 
        Pittsburgh c. 1812-1816. Through Williams Patterson soon came into 
        contact with the highly motivated Spalding claims researcher, James T. 
        Cobb of Salt Lake City and much of Cobb's enthusiasm for this line of 
        research seems to have quickly rubbed off onto Patterson. Whether 
        Patterson solicited the Feb. 12, 1879 article from Creigh, or whether it 
        was Creigh who first approached Patterson on that matter remains 
        unknown. At the very least the interests of both Creigh and Patterson 
        regarding the Spalding authorship claims appear to have converged early 
        in 1879. For a contemporary letter by Patterson on this subject, see the 
        <I>Commercial-Gazette</I> of <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#021779">Feb. 
        17, 1879</A>. From this point forward it was Robert Patterson, Jr. who 
        carried forward most of the new research on the Spalding authorship 
        claims (at least he was the primary researcher of this subject in 
        western Pennsylvania in the early 1880s). For example, in August of 1879 
        Patterson was inspired to seek out and interview the aging D. P. Hurlbut 
        at Gibsonburg, Ohio and obtain a statement from him (printed in the 
        <I>Leader</I> <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#020080">in 
        Feb. 1880</A> ) regarding the man's involvement in the 1833 effort to 
        recover the writings of Solomon Spalding. It was probably his 
        frustrations and subsequent realizations, developing out of his failed 
        effort to obtain useful information from Hurlbut that motivated 
        Patterson to continue and expand his search for the facts underlying the 
        old Spalding claims.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>We publish in this issue the facts in relation to the origin 
        of the Book of Mormon. It is a curious piece of history which persons 
        yet living can verify. It is due to those who have been deceived by this 
        imposture; to the country under whose institutions it has become so 
        powerful and so insolent, and to christianity which it presumes to 
        supplant as "the church of the latter day saints of Jesus Christ," that 
        some permanent memorial shall be erected to identify and make clear the 
        time, place and circumstances of [its[ origin. Solomon Spalding, as a 
        man or a preacher, is not entitled to any special notice save as the 
        innocent author of a system of religion [which it is fair?] to do a 
        great amount of harm to us as a people and a government. The system is a 
        fraud, although it claims a divine origin, and while the living 
        witnesses of this imposture still exist, [some?] efforts should be made 
        to mark the spot where its author lies, in such a manner as will 
        identify it as a historical fact. In a few years the grave of Spaulding 
        will only be known by tradition, nothing being left to mark the place. 
        The living witnesses will have died, and then in time, it may be a 
        question in the minds of many whether such a man really lived, and 
        whether the origin of the Book of Mormon is not a fiction. In the name 
        of christianity which it shames, a monument should be reared as a 
        protest against the imposture which threatens to mislead so many 
        simple-minded people, and to involve our country in evils of the 
        greatest magnitude. The different christian churches should unite and 
        place a durable monument of granite upon the grave of Spaulding as a 
        permanent memorial which will remind the people of the outrages and 
        crimes perpetrated in the name of a religion which claims to be divine. 
        The christianity of Washington county owes it to itself and the country 
        that this memorial shall be solemnly made. A few hundred dollars thus 
        invested will rear a monument which will be permenant portest against 
        the claims of "the latter day Saints" of Utah. <BR><BR>Will not some of 
        our church bodies move in this matter before the living witnesses shall 
        have departed? What is done should be done with. </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>To the Editors of the Commercial Gazette:</I> 
        <BR><BR>Having read with interest your editorial of the 8th inst.: A 
        Question of Authorship," I have watched your columns in the hope that 
        some of our older citizens would responf to your very timely suggestion. 
        If, as generally believed, the romance of Rev. Solomon Spaulding, 
        entitled the "Manuscript Found," was surreptitously obtained from a 
        printing office in Pittsburghm about the year 1815, and reappeared in 
        1830 under the transforming hand of Sidney Rigdon, as the "Book of 
        Mormon," it is reasonable to suppose, as you remark, that "there must be 
        several persons in the city of Pittsburgh able to say whether these 
        statements are correct, and it seems therefore worthwhile to repeat them 
        once more with the view of having them attested or denied." Permit me to 
        add my voice to yours in urging that such of your readers as have facts 
        to communicate on this point would give them to the public <I>at 
        once.</I> Dr. Sharp, to whom you refer, has set an example which should 
        be generally followed and possibly much additional light may yet be shed 
        upon this question of disputed authorship. Its possible influence upon 
        the minds of Mormons themselves should not be forgotten. <BR>&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; R. P. 
        <BR><BR>
        <HR width=120>
        <BR><SMALL><I>To the Editors of the Commercial Gazette:</I> <BR><BR>Your 
        "Question of Authorship," relating to the origin of Mormonism, in 
        today's issue, leads me to drop you this item. So far back as 1822 the 
        firm of Patterson &amp; Lambdin, (a shade of doubt about the last name 
        of the firm) did business as Publishers, Bookbinders and Booksellers, at 
        the southeast corner of the Diamond and Market street. <FONT 
        color=maroon>At the same time Sidney Rigdon, tanner and currier, had his 
        tan-yard and shop on Penn street, on the lot running from Penn Avenue to 
        Allegheny above Ninth street. The shop stood where the Drs. Dicksons' 
        office now is.</FONT> In 1841 the administrators of my father's estate 
        found among the papers an unpaid note bearing Rigdon's signature. It was 
        not long after 1822 that Rigdon was reported to have gone to Eastern 
        Ohio. <BR><BR>After the Book of Mormon had appeared, it was remembered 
        by many who read it, and by the members of Mr. Spaulding's family, that 
        parts of it were a reconstruction of [his manuscript?] which had been 
        sent to the Patterson [brs.?] I think this firm went out of the 
        publishing part of their business about that time. Putting these things 
        together, it is likely that, in the business transactions between 
        book-binder and tanner, Sidney Rigdon took the Spaulding manuscript to 
        Ohio, and he became the real, whilst Joseph Smith was the ostensible 
        originator of the Mormon fraud. Rigdon was for a time one of the "Twelve 
        Apostles" of that system, but never gave his assent to its teachings on 
        polygamy. He visited Pittsburgh between 1844 and 1850. As a singular 
        coincidence, in 1841, one of the early residents of Pittsburgh told me 
        that she was at a meeting in a Baptist church in Pittsburgh, and on that 
        evening, Sidney Rigdon and Alexander Campbell both dissolved their 
        connection with the Baptist denomination. The influence of both, as 
        founders of schools or religious thought, has been widely extended, 
        although of very different notions and tendencies. &nbsp; Y.<BR>&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; P<SMALL>ARNASSUS</SMALL>, PA., Feb. 
        15, 1879. <BR></SMALL><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note 1: The 
        first letter was written by the Rev. Robert Patterson, Jr., the son of 
        the publisher with whom Solomon had dealings over sixty years previous 
        (and in 1879, the assistent editor of the <I>Presbyterian Banner,</I> 
        published in Pittsburgh. <BR><BR>Note 2: The second correspondent 
        provides valuable information, saying that "Sidney Rigdon, tanner and 
        currier, had his tan-yard and shop <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/features/Tann1852.jpg">on Penn 
        street</A>." A "currier" of those days prepared leather for special use 
        by treating the rawhide with certain chemicals, trimming it to a uniform 
        thickness, and polishing its outer surface. In a c. 1900 account, 
        Sidney's son, John W. Rigdon, mentioned that his father formed a 
        partnership with Richard S. Brooks to open the short-lived tannery. John 
        calls this same Richard (who was Rigdon's brother-in-law) a 
        <I>corroyeur,</I> so it seems likely that Sidney improved upon his 
        previous, undocumented tanning training, to become a leather dresser 
        (currier) as well as a leather maker. When the business was dissolved in 
        1825, Sidney's partner at that time was Richard's brother, William S. 
        Brooks. All of Sideny Rigdon's Brooks family brothers-in-law probably 
        had some amount of training in the trade, as their father, Jeremiah 
        Brooks, owned and operated a tannery near Warren, Ohio. One such special 
        use would have been the manufacture of leather sheets for book-binding. 
        An example of the early need for curriers in Pittsburgh may be seen in 
        an advertisement in the <I>Mercury</I> for May 20, 1813, reading: 
        "Wanted immediately -- A tanner and currier -- apply at the office of 
        the Mercury." The same paper advertised for "journeyman book-binders" in 
        its issue of <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1810.htm#081014">Aug. 
        10, 1814</A>, requesting respondents to apply to "R. and J. Patterson." 
        See also Isaac Craig's letter of <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/Eich1879.htm#1882a">Oct. 14, 
        1882</A>, where he says: "Rigdon had a small tannery on Penn street, 
        near Hand, for the manufacture of book-binders sheep-skins, and 
        supplying these to the office brought him in contact with [Silas] 
        Engles. This impression I obtained from John Sandersen, an old time 
        butcher, who sold sheep pelts to Rigdon." <BR><BR>Note 3: The second 
        correspondent also says, "it is likely that, in the business 
        transactions between book-binder and tanner, Sidney Rigdon took the 
        Spaulding manuscript..." Sidney Rigdon, after he was removed by the 
        orthodox Baptists of Pittsburgh, preached Campbellite doctrines to a 
        small band of seceders at the court house in that city. At some point 
        became a "journeyman tanner" in the Pittsburgh area and was able to work 
        at that occupation after his dismissal from the regular Baptists. 
        Rebecca J. Eichbaum, who knew Rigdon at Pittsburgh, in her <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/Eich1879.htm#pg04">1879 
        statement</A>, says: "He was connected with the tannery before he became 
        a preacher, though he may have continued the business whilst preaching. 
        Rebecca's statement is confirmed by Rigdon's own <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/Rigd1843.htm#p193">1843 
        autobiographical sketch</A>, where he states: "Having now retired from 
        the ministry, and having no way by which to sustain his family, besides 
        his own industry, he was necessiated to find other employment in order 
        to provide for his maintenance, and for this purpose he engaged in the 
        humble capacity of a journeyman tanner, in that city, and followed his 
        new employment, without murmuring, for two years." Of course Rev. Rigdon 
        could not have gone to work as a "journeyman" tanner without first 
        having earlier served an apprenticeship in that same trade. <BR><BR>Note 
        4:As a "currier," Rigdon would have had personal acquaintance with the 
        leather book-binding industry in Pittsburgh. The main questions to be 
        answered are <U>when and where</U> Rigdon first worked as a currier and 
        <U>when</U> Robert &amp; Joseph Patterson (and/or their business 
        associate Jonathan Harrison Lambdin) were first engaged in the 
        book-binding trade in Pittsburgh. For more discussion on this point see 
        the notes accompanying the ad for "tanning and currying" in the 
        <I>Mercury</I> of <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1820.htm#112022">Nov. 
        20, 1822</A>. It may be relevant, that in his <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IL/sain1872.htm#101576">1842 
        interview</A> with Robert Patterson, Sr., LDS Apostle John E. Page was

        maintained by Patterson for book publishing in Pittsburgh, until 
        "several years" after Solomon Spalding's 1816 death. A likely period for 
        this "connection" would have been in 1824, when Rigdon was a tanner and

      <BLOCKQUOTE><I>To the Editor of the Telegraph:</I><BR>The most direct 
        and important testimony which has yet been given, bearing upon this 
        question, is the letter of the widow of Rev. Solomon Spaulding, which 
        was published in the Boston <I>Recorder,</I> in its issue of April 19, 
        1839, only nine years after the appearance of the Book of Mormon. It has 
        been repeatedly reprinted, but there are many of the present generation 
        who have not seen it, and who will peruse it with deep interest. 
        Especially will this be the case in this city and vicinity, which may be 
        regarded as the birthplace of this great imposture. The prefatory note 
        from Rev. John Storrs, at that time (1839) pastor of the Congregational 
        Church in Holliston, Mass., fully explains the occasion for writing this 
        letter, and the appended testimonies of Rev. Messrs. Ely and Austin, of 
        Monson, Mass., emphatically sustain the reliability of Mrs. Davison.

        obtaining the 1839 Boston Recorder article typescript, since Cobb had 
        several old friends and relatives then living in the Boston area. Cobb

      <BLOCKQUOTE>As will be seen by the minutes elsewhere, the Historical 
        Society has appointed a committee to take measures to perpetuate the 
        memory of Rev. Solomon Spaulding, a citizen of this county and the 
        author of the so-called Bible of the Mormons. The collection of 
        marvelous statements which make up that wonderful piece of sacred 
        fiction was written, it is generally believed by the above gentleman as 
        a sort of intellectual gymnastic exercise, and to pass away the idle 
        hours, never thinking it would become the standard of faith for a people 
        gathered from all parts of the world controlling one of the richest 
        territories belonging to the United States. The work was never printed, 
        but the manuscript was left to careless hands as a thing of no value. 
        How Joe Smith, the high priest of Mormonism, got possession of it, we 
        have not heard, but it is said that it can be clearly proven that the 
        story which Solomon Spaulding, the Washington county preacher, wrote for 
        fun, is substantially the same that Joseph Smith, the apostle of 
        polygamy, palmed off for gospel. The work of this committee will be, in 
        addition to making this fact well understood beyond quibble, to devise 
        some permanent memorial of the obscure country preacher, who, however 
        unwittingly, shaped the foundation stones for the religion of Utah.

      <P align=center><B><BIG>THE &nbsp;MORMON &nbsp;QUESTION.</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>At last hope is awakened that something decisive is about to 
        be done by the Government in relation to the Mormon iniquties which have 
        been such a foul blot on the land. It is well known that the additions 
        to Mormonism are mostly from Europe, obtained for the most part under 
        false pretences, and in expectation of light labor and comfortable 
        living. If this importation can be stopped a long step will have been 
        taken towards solving the Mormon problem. <BR><BR>By direction of the 
        President, Secretary Evarts has sent a letter to our Ministers to Great 
        Britian, Germany, and several lesser powers, protesting against their 
        allowing subjects who are Mormons to leave for the United States. It 
        sets forth that under the laws of this country bigamy is a crime, and 
        that persons leaving foreign countries for the purpose of settling in 
        Utah go there with the intention of violating the laws of this country. 
        Reference is made in the letter to the fact that according to our 
        treaties with these countries they are under obligations not to allow 
        parties to depart from their jurisdiction who are known to have criminal 
        intentions. The President holds that after having given these nations 
        notice, the Mormons coming here as such render themselves liable to 
        prosecution under our criminal laws, and that we will then be justified 
        in refusing them admission to our ports. <BR><BR>In the meantime the 
        Mormons in Utah have made themselves as agreeable as possible to the 
        Labor Investgating Committee. It is reported that during its stay its 
        members were the guests of the Mormons, who furnished carriages in 
        profusion and carried them to places of interest. They visited John 
        Taylor, and looked over the Tabernacle, the Mormon Temple, and then 
        drove out to the Penitentiary to visit Cannon and his co-excutors, who 
        are imprisoned for contempt. There they partook of a collation together 
        and had a good time. They listened to Cannon's version of the story, 
        believed him the victim of judicial bigotry, and promised to use their 
        influence to secure his release and to procure Statehood for Utah. These 
        visitors were so constantly surrounded by much-married saints that 
        Gentiles would not approach them. The Committee and their friends left 
        for San Francisco in the confident belief that they knew all about 
        Mormonism. Loyal citizens are inquiring if the public money is paid to 
        their representatives to encourage a disloyal sect in wrong-doing? 
        <BR><BR>This if true -- and we are afraid it is, is most discreditable 
        to that committee and should be severely rebuked. It is very certain 
        that since the visit of that committee the Mormons have become more 
        defiant and threatening towards other people now resident in Utah.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>The London <I>Times</I> having editorially on the 12th inst. 
        objected to the circular of the U. S. Government on Mormon emigration, 
        on the ground that any interference with Mormons would be a kind of 
        inquisition into religious opinions, the attention of President Hays was 
        called to the article, and he is reported to have said that the circular 
        must have been misunderstood, that it does not make the slightest 
        reference to religion, and that it invites the co-operation of foreign 
        governments in discouraging Mormon emigration, for the protection of 
        their own deluded subjects as well as to prevent an influx into this 
        country of persons coming with criminal intent. Whatever other 
        governments may do in the matter, our own government is determined to 
        enforce the laws against bigamy, and in this is entitled to the support 
        of all good citizens. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Notes:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>In reply to many criticisms, Mr. Smith, the Mormon preacher 
        of Pittsburgh, sends us a small letter of about forty pages, which he 
        requests us to print as 'an act of justice' to him. * * * We have to be 
        just to our readers as well as to Mr. Smith, and can not therefore 
        surrender the space where they have a right to look for news, to the 
        missionary efforts of any sect whatever. It should be sufficient hustice 
        to Elder Smith to say right now and here, as we frankly do, that the 
        evidence by which it is sought to prove that 'Joe' Smith or Sidney 
        Rigdon stole the manuscript copy of Rev. Solomon Spaulding's romance, 
        and made the Book of Mormon out of it, is <SMALL>FATALLY 
        DEFECTIVE</SMALL>. The thing can not be proved. The Mormons 
        <SMALL>SUCCESSFULLY RIDDLE</SMALL> the testimony of those who assert it, 
        and very fairly demand that Spaulding's romance be produced and the 
        comparison made or the slander be dropped. The fact that this romance. 
        though alleged to have remained in Gentile hands, never has been 
        produced, and can not be now, is prima facie evidence that it is not the 
        original of the Book of Mormon. 
        <P></P><BR><FONT color=maroon size=3>Note 1: Apostle Thomas Wood Smith 
        (1838-1894) was the chief RLDS Elder in Pittsburgh at this time. Smith 
        was a native of Pennsylvania and probably had some relational ties to 
        those Pittsburgh area Rigdonites who eventually joined with the RLDS. 
        His "Mormon" missionary activities in Pittsburgh aroused the unwelcome 
        attention of several people who were opposed to his religion. Utah 
        journalist James T. Cobb apparently submitted more than one letter or 
        article to the Pittsburgh papers, written opposition of the assertion of 
        Elder Smith and others like him. Robert Patterson, Jr. wrote to Cobb 
        from Pittsburgh on Sept. 6, 1879, saying: "... I cannot find your case 
        on the Rigdons in the <I>Com. Gaz.</I> of Aug. 18. Possibly it was in 
        some other Pittsburgh paper?" Again, on Feb. 28, 1881, Patterson says to 
        Cobb:"I mail herewith Pittsburgh 'Dispatch' of this date with your reply 
        to Mr. T. W. Smith." Apparently the joyrnalistic conversation between 
        Elder Smith and his opponents moved back and forth between the pages of 
        the <I>Leader</I> and those of the <I>Dispatch</I> between 1879 and 
        1881. Elder Smith had a lengthy letter published in a <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#000081">January 
        1881 issue</A> of the <I>Leader.</I> <BR><BR>Note 2: It is supposed that 
        Robert Patterson, Jr.'s Aug. 19, 1879 interview with D. P. Hurlbut was 
        published in an issue of the <I>Leader</I> soon after the that paper's 
        Feb. 20th notice regarding the local activities of Elder Thomas W. 
        Smith. The exact date for the appearance of Patterson's interview in the 
        Pittsburgh papers remains unknown.

        that he did receive the manuscript from the widow of Spaulding in 1834 
        [sic - 1833?], which manuscript he gave to E. D. Howe of Painesville, 
        P., but declares his entire ignorance of the contents of that 
        manuscript. He says this was the only Spaulding Manuscript he ever had 
        in his possession. Mr. Howe states that this manuscript was not the one 
        known as the 'Manuscript Found,' but was on an entirely different 
        subject... <BR><BR><SMALL>
        <DIV align=right><SMALL>GIBSONBURG, OHIO, Aug. 19, 1879.</SMALL> &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; </DIV>I visited Mrs. Matilda (Spaulding) Davison at 
        Monson, Mass., in 1834, and never saw her afterward. I then received 
        from her a manuscript of her husband's, which I did not read, but 
        brought home with me, and immediately gave it to Mr. E. D. Howe, of 
        Painesville, Ohio, who was then engaged in preparing his book -- 
        "Mormonism Unvailed." I do not know whether or not the document I 
        received from Mrs. Davison was Spaulding's "Manuscript Found," as I 
        never read it entire, and it convinced me that it was not the Spaulding 
        manuscript; but whatever it was, Mr. Howe received it under the 
        condition on which I took it from Mrs. Davison -- to compare it with the 
        "Book of Mormon," and then to return it to her. I never received any 
        other manuscript of Spaulding's from Mrs. Davison, or any one else. Of 
        that manuscript I made no other use than to give it, with all my other 
        documents connected with Mormonism, to Mr. Howe. I did not destroy the 
        manuscript nor dispose of it to Joe Smith, or to any other person. No 
        promise was made by me to Mrs. Davison that she should receive any 
        portion of the profits arising from the publication of the manuscript, 
        if it should be published. All the affidavits procured by me for Mr. 
        Howe's book, including all those from Palmyra, N. Y., were certainly 
        genuine.

        Patterson" came to visit (August, 1879?), nor <U>who</U> was related to 
        Sidney Rigdon. Apparently Robert Patterson, Jr. claimed this family 
        relationship for his own father, the Rev. Robert Patterson, Sr. If the 
        Pattersons and the Rigdons were related, the connection must have been a 
        distant one. Perhaps Sidney Rigdon was somehow related to Patterson's

      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>In the last issue of <I>Scribner's</I> is an article 
        which professes to show that the Morman religion is based on a romance 
        written in this century, and which was made public by a disreputable 
        young scamp who by some means got possession of the manuscript. The 
        subject may be familiar to some of our readers, but it is certainly new 
        to many. The principal part of the <I>Scribner</I> article is an 
        affidavit of Mrs. McKinstry, the daughter of Rev. Mr. Spaulding. Mrs. 
        McKinstry is now living in Washington, but has a clear recollection of 
        the facts which she gives to the public through one of her nephews. 
        About 1812 Mr. Spaulding removed to Conneaut, Ohio, and while there 
        became interested in the curious mounds which abound in that section of 
        country. He caused several to be opened, and inspired by the findings 
        wrote a romance, entitled, "Manuscript Found." He sent this to Mr. 
        Patterson, of Pittsburgh, a printer, who kept it in his possession for 
        several years, and finally returned it without publication. In Mr. 
        Patterson's employ was a man named Rigdon, the famous Mormon apostle in 
        after years. The manuscript of the romance was left in an open trunk for 
        many years after Mr. Spaulding's death, and the trunk was also stored in 
        the house of Mr. Sabine, for whom Joseph Smith, afterwards the Mormon 
        leader, drove team. This Joseph Smith about 1824 began talking of 
        religious revelations and a new religion founded on a "seer stone" which 
        he had discovered. Some years after the "Mormon bible" was printed and 
        Mr. Spaulding's brother, his daughters, wife and others who had heard 
        the story of the "Manuscript Found" read, declared the two were 
        identical, but as the trunk containing this manuscript, with other 
        papers of the deceased author was stored at friend's in New York, no 
        actual comparison was made. In after years a man named Hulbert, a 
        Mormon, got possession of the manuscript of the story, and it is said 
        had it destroyed. Joseph Smith, the Mormon leader, and Rigdon, another 
        apostle, were placed in such a position as to have access to the story, 
        and it is presumed that one or the other copied it, and on this romance; 
        written by an Ohio preacher, was rounded the greatest religious sham of 
        the century, and the one which is puzzling the government of the United 
        States. <BR></SMALL><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Notes:

      <BLOCKQUOTE>The Salt Lake Tribune says: "There was a Gentile celebration 
        here on the Fourth of July, and a Mormon celebration on the 24th of the 
        same month. The Mormons are as five to one in the majority, and their 
        effort was to make a showing which should dwarf the display on the 
        Fourth. So far as their procession was concerned they succeeded, but 
        there they stopped. Their crowd marched as veteran soldiers might take 
        up a weary and distasteful march, because they were ordered to. There 
        was no enthusiasm either in the procession or on the streets, when the 
        services were over the participants retired out of sight, save a few 
        that were too drunk to leave. On the Fourth the streets were thronged 
        with young Utah. They were forbitten to take part in the proceedings, 
        but they were here to see what was going on. The difference in the 
        spirit of the two days was most marked, and if we mistake not in a 
        thousand Mormon homes the question has since been asked, 'Why, living in 
        this great Republic, could we not join in celebrating its birthday?' In 
        this respect the little celebration on the Fourth was a grand success; 
        the big celebration on the 24th was a grand failure. The truth is that 
        the iron rule of the Mormon masters, while it seems as firm as ever, is 
        breaking down. The instinct of boys born in America is to gain wealth 
        and honorable name. The instinct of girls born and reared in America is 
        to dress well, to gain knowledge, to mingle with the best society, and 
        to secure as fair and as honorable a husband as possible. Both these 
        instincts are in direct conflict with the Mormon feature of polygamy. 
        And the leaders will in the next few years be forced to decide whether 
        to give up that article of their creed or to see their whole system of 
        fraud tumble to pieces about their ears." <BR><FONT color=maroon

      <BLOCKQUOTE>The interest attaching to the question, Who wrote the "Book 
        of Mormon?" leads us to publish the following correspondence and 
        communication of Abner Jackson, of Canton, Ohio, through Mr. John Aiken 
        in behalf of the Washington County Historical Society. 
        <BR><BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C<SMALL>ANTON</SMALL>, O<SMALL>HIO</SMALL>, 
        &nbsp; Dec. 20, 1880. <BR><I>Mr. John Aiken, Esq.: -- </I>I here send 
        you the document you solicited so long ago. You see, though a long time 
        coming, that it is poorly written: but I am too old to do it very well. 
        I hope you will be able to read it. You probably have seen Mrs. 
        McKinstry's statement in Scribner's <I>Monthly</I> <SMALL>(already 
        published in the Washington <I>Reporter</I> -- Eds.)</SMALL> for August, 
        1880. I wish to say that I have not seen her or had any intelligence 
        from her, since they left Conneaut. If any should think we have 
        conferred in any way to make out a case of plagiarism against Joseph 
        Smith, let them know that so far as we are concerned, we are now perfect 
        strangers. I did not know that she was living until I heard, as stated 
        in the accompanying paper. If so many errors had not been published 
        there would be no necessity for this statement. When contradicting 
        statements are published, people often say, one is wrong, maybe neither 
        is right, and so ignore both. Mrs. McKinstry says that her father's iron 
        works was a foundry. This was the little girl's view of it. It was a 
        forge of the older type. Iron was made from ore under a trip hammer, as 
        there were no rollers in this country at that time. But this is not 
        essential, and has nothing to do with Mormonism. <BR><BR>If my statement 
        is not published, please return it to me as soon as convenient. Please 
        inform me if you receive this. I am not anxious for myself at all, but 
        if you can do anything for those entangled by the delusion, it cannot be 
        published too quickly. I hope your Historical Society may prosper and do 
        much good.

        <BR><BR><BR><BR><B>ABNER &nbsp;JACKSON'S &nbsp;STATEMENT.</B> 
        </CENTER><BR><BR><SMALL>It is a fact well established that the book 
        called the <I>Book of Mormon,</I> had its origin from a romance that was 
        written by Solomon Spaulding, in Conneaut, a small village in Ashtabula 
        County, Ohio, about A. D. 1812. Spaulding was a highly educated man 
        about six feet high, of rather slender build, with a dark complexion, 
        black eyes, black hair, rather slow of speech, never trifling, pleasant 
        in conversation, but seldom laughing aloud. His deportment was grave and 
        dignified in society, and he was much respected by those of his 
        acquaintance. He was a clergyman of the Presbyterian order, and for a 
        time a settled pastor in the city of New York. So said his brother John 
        Spaulding and others in the neighborhood, who heard him preach. It was 
        said that failing health caused him to resign the pastorate. He then 
        came to Richfield, Otsego County, New York, and started a store, near 
        where my father lived, about the beginning of the present century. 
        <BR><BR>Spaulding contracted for large tracts of land along the shore of 
        Lake Erie, on each side of the State line, in both Pennsylvania and 
        Ohio. My father exchanged with him the farm on which he lived in Otsego 
        County, New York, for land in Erie County, Pa., where the town of Albion 
        now stands, and moved on it A.D. 1805. It was then a dense forest. 
        Shortly after my father moved, Spaulding sold his store in Richfield, 
        and moved to Conneaut, Ashtabula County, Ohio, and built a forge on 
        Conneaut Creek, two miles from Conneaut Harbor and two miles from the 
        State line. In building this he failed, sold out, and about the 
        beginning of the year 1812, commenced to write his famous romance called 
        by him "The Manuscript Found." <BR><BR>This romance, Mr. Spaulding 
        brought with him on a visit to my father, a short time before he moved 
        from Conneaut to Pittsburgh. At that time I was confined to the house 
        with a lame knee, and so I was in company with them and heard the 
        conversation that passed between them. Spaulding read much of his 
        manuscript to my father, and in conversation with him, explained his 
        views of the old fortifications in this country, and told his Romance. A 
        note in Morse's Geography suggested it as a possibility that our Indians 
        were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. Said Morse, they might 
        have wandered through Asia up to Behring's Strait, and across the Strait 
        to this continent. Besides there were habits and ceremonies among them 
        that resembled some habits and ceremonies among the Israelites of that 
        day. Then the old fortifications and earth mounds, containing so many 
        kinds of relics and human bones, and some of them so large, altogether 
        convinced him that they were a larger race and more enlightened and 
        civilized than are found among the Indians among us at this day. These 
        facts and reflections prompted him to write his Romance, purporting to 
        be <FONT color=maroon>a history of the lost tribes of Israel.</FONT> 
        <BR><BR>He begins with their departure from Palestine or Judea, then up 
        through Asia, points out their exposures, hardships, and sufferings, 
        also their disputes and quarrels. especially when they built their craft 
        for passing over the Straits. Then after their landing he gave an 
        account of their divisions and subdivisions under different leaders, but 
        two parties controlled the balance. One of them was called the 
        Righteous, worshipers and servants of God. These organized with 
        prophets, priests, and teachers, for the education of their children, 
        and settled down to cultivate the soil, and to a life of civilization. 
        The others were Idolaters. They contended for a life of idleness; in 
        short, a wild, wicked, savage life. <BR><BR>They soon quarreled, and 
        then commenced war anew, and continued to fight, except at very short 
        intervals. Sometimes one party was successful and sometimes the other, 
        until finally a terrible battle was fought, which was conclusive. All 
        the Righteous were slain, except one, and he was Chief Prophet and 
        Recorder. He was notified of the defeat in time by Divine authority; 
        told where, when and how to conceal the record, and He would take care 
        that it should be preserved, and brought to light again at the proper 
        time, for the benefit of mankind. So the Recorder professed to do, and 
        then submitted to his fate. I do not remember what that fate was. He was 
        left alone of his party. I do not remember that anything more was said 
        of him. <BR><BR>Spaulding's Romance professed to find the Record where 
        the Recorder concealed it, in one of those mounds, one of which was but 
        a few rods from Spaulding's residence. Soon after this visit, Spaulding 
        moved to Pittsburgh, and took his manuscript to the Pittsburgh 
        <I>Gazette</I> office, intending to have it printed, but in this he 
        failed. My brother, J. J. Jackson, was a recruiting officer in the U. S. 
        Army, and stationed at Pittsburgh at that time. Being well acquainted 
        with Spaulding and his lady he soon found them, and in his letters home 
        would inform us how they were getting along. The last account he gave us 
        of them was that he was selling pictures and she was sewing up clothing 
        for the soldiers. The next we heard of them was by report. Spaulding 
        moved to Amity, Washington County, Pa., and soon after died and was 
        buried there. His wife and daughter went to her brother, Lawyer Sabine, 
        Onondagp Valley, Onondago, Co., N.Y. When I was returning from 
        Clarksburg, W.Va., to my home in New Brighton, Beaver Co., Pa., A. D. 
        1840, I passed through Amity, hunted the grave of Spaulding and copied 
        from the headstone the following inscription: <BR><BR>
        <P align=center>IN &nbsp;MEMORY &nbsp;OF<BR><SMALL>Solomon Spaulding, 
        who departed this life Oct. 20th, A.D., 1816, aged 55 years. <BR>
        <DIR>
        <DIR>
        <DIR>"Kind cherubs guard the sleeping clay,<BR>Until the great decision 
        day.<BR>And saints complete in glory rise,<BR>To share the triumphs of 
        the skies." </DIR></DIR></DIR></SMALL>
        <P></P>Spaulding frequently read his manuscript to the neighbors and 
        amused them as he progressed with his work. He wrote it in Bible style, 
        "And it came to pass" occurred so often that some called him "old come 
        to pass." <BR><BR>So much for Spaulding's Romance; now for the Book of 
        Mormon. <BR><BR>The first account of the Book of Mormon that I saw, was 
        a notice in my father's newspaper, stating that Joseph Smith, Jr., 
        professed having dreamed that an angel had appeared to him and told him 
        to go and search in a place he named in Palmyra, N. Y., and he would 
        find a gold-leaf Bible. Smith was incredulous and did not go until the 
        second or third time he dreamed the same dream. Then he said he went 
        and, to his surprise, he found the golden Bible, according to his 
        dreams. But it was written in a language so ancient that none could be 
        found able either to read it or tell in what language it was written. 
        Sometime after another statement appeared, that an angel had consented 
        to read and interpret it to Joseph Smith, and he should report it to a 
        third person who should write it in plain English, so that all might 
        read the new Bible and understand its import. Some time after, in 1830, 
        the book was published at Palmyra, N. Y., called a "New Revelation: the 
        Book of Mormon." This purports to be a history of the lost tribes of the 
        Children of Israel. It begins with them just where the romance did, and 
        it follows the romance very closely. It is true there are some verbal 
        alterations and additions, enlarging the production somewhat, without 
        changing its main features. The Book of Mormon follows the romance too 
        closely to be a stranger. In both, many persons appear having the same 
        name; as Maroni, Mormon, Nephites, Moroni, Lama, Nephe, and others. 
        <BR><BR>Here then we are presented with Romance, second, called the Book 
        of Mormon, telling the same story of the same people, traveling from the 
        same plain, in the same way, having the same difficulties and 
        destination, with the same wars, same battles, and same results, with 
        thousands upon thousands slain. Then see the Mormon account of the last 
        battle, at Cumorah, where all the righteous were slain. They were called 
        the Nephites, the others were called Lamanites (see Moroni's account of 
        the closing scene) "and it came to pass that a great battle was fought 
        at Cumorah. The Lamanites slew all the Nephites" (except Moroni), and he 
        said "I will write and hide up the Recorder [sic] in the earth, and 
        whither I go it mattereth not." Book of Mormon, page 344, third American 
        edition. How much this resembles the closing scene in the "Manuscript 
        Found." The most singular part of the whole matter is, that it follows 
        the Romance so closely, with this difference: the first claims to be a 
        romance; the second claims to be a revelation of God, a new Bible! When 
        it was brought to Conneaut and read there in public, old Esq. Wright 
        heard it, and exclaimed, "'Old come to pass' has come to life again." 
        Here was the place where Spaulding wrote and read his manuscript to the 
        neighbors for their amusement and 'Squire Wright had often heard him 
        read from his Romance. This was in 1832, sixteen years after Spaulding's 
        death. This 'Squire Wright lived on a farm just outside of the little 
        village. I was acquainted with him for twenty-five years. I lived on his 
        farm when I was a boy and attended school in the village. I am 
        particular to notice these things to show that I had an opportunity of 
        knowing what I am writing about. <BR><BR>After I commenced writing this 
        article, I heard that an article in <I>Scribner's Monthly,</I> for 
        August, 1880, on the "Book of Mormon," contained a note and affidavit of 
        Mrs. Matilda S. McKinstry, Solomon Spaulding's only child, stating that 
        she remembered her father's Romance. I sent at once for the 
        <I>Monthly,</I> and on the 613, 614, 615 and 616 pages, found the 
        article and her testimony. Her statement from the commencement, until 
        they moved to Pittsburgh, in all <I>essential particulars</I> I know to 
        be true. She relates those acts as they occurred to my own personal 
        knowledge, though she was then a little girl. She is now about 
        seventy-five years of age. <BR><BR>I stated before that I knew nothing 
        of Spaulding after he moved to Pittsburgh, except by letters and 
        newspapers. He soon moved to Amity, Washington County, Pa., and shortly 
        after this he died and his wife went to her brother's. His daughter's 
        account of the deceitful method by which Hurlburt gained possession of 
        and retained Spaulding's manuscript, is, I think, important and should 
        not be lost sight of. She was no child then. I think she has done her 
        part well in the vindication of the truth by her unvarnished statement 
        of what she remembered of her father's Romance. I have not seen her 
        since she was a little girl, but I have seen both of these productions, 
        heard Spaulding read much of his Romance to my father and explain his 
        views and reasons for writing it. I also have seen and read the Book of 
        Mormon, and it follows Spaulding's romance too closely to be anything 
        else than a borrowed production from the romance. I think that Mrs. 
        McKinstry's statement fills a gap in my account from Spalding's removal 
        to Pittsburgh, to the death of his wife in 1844. I wish, if my statement 
        is published that hers also be published with it, that the truth may be 
        vindicated by the truth beyond any reasonable doubt. <BR><BR>&nbsp;

        if not altogether disappeared, through the ravages of time and relic

        cause of this stupendous fraud of Mormonism, and also to the truth of 
        history, that this tomb-stone be replaced by a suitable and substantial 
        monument bearing the original inscription together with such other 
        legends as may perpetuate the memory of the origin of the greatest

      <P align=center><B><BIG>That Plagiarized "Book of Mormon."</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The proposed celebration in Washington county in memory of 
        Rev. Solomon Spaulding, author of the "Book of Mormon," is apparently 
        creating considerable comment in religious circles here. It has for many 
        years been announced that Rev. Spaulding was the original author of the 
        Mormon Bible, which is more commonly known as the "Book of Mormon." But 
        now comes a Latter Day Saint, or Mormon preacher, T. W. Smith by name, 
        who for some time past has been preaching in a hall on Fourth avenue in 
        this city. Mr. Smith, in a lengthy communication to a morning paper, 
        makes the astounding statement and furnishes some proof to the effect 
        that Rev. Spaulding was not the author of the "Book of Mormon." He 
        claims that according to common assertions, Rev. Spaulding wrote in 1812 
        a romance which he called "Manuscript Found," and that about 1814 the 
        manuscript was sent to a Mr. Patterson of Pittsburg, who kept a printing 
        office in the city. It was also calimed that one Sidney Rigdon, having 
        access to the office of Mr. Patterson, copied the manuscript, and that 
        he and Joseph Smith subsequently had it published to the world as the 
        "Book of Mormon." T. W. Smith further says: <BR><BR><SMALL>"Mrs. 
        McKinstry, daughter of the Rev. Spaulding, and wife of Dr. A. McKinstry 
        of Monson, Mass., states that her father died at Amity, Pa., in 1816; 
        that directly after, with her mother, she went to visit an uncle named 
        Sabine, in Onondaga county, New York; that she saw a manuscript, 'about 
        an inch thick, closely written, tied with some stories my father had 
        written for me.' On the outside of this manuscript were written the 
        words, 'Manuscript Found.' That in 1834 a Mr. Hurlbert came to her 
        mother (who had in 1820 married a Mr. Davidson), and from her, by an 
        order on Mr. Jerome Clark, with whom she had placed the manuscript, he 
        obtained the same. This Hurlbert was an excommunicated Mormon, and in 
        retaliation for his expulsion sought to destroy the Book of Mormon, 
        thinking from what he had heard that this 'Manuscript Found' was the 
        basis of the Book of Mormon, the latter being the same work with 'slight 
        alterations.'" <BR></SMALL><BR>Mr. Smith now claims that Hurlburt never 
        returned the MSS. to Mrs. K.; that he still possesses it, and that it 
        can be obtained by law. Mr. Smith is over-anxious that Mr. Hurlburt's 
        MSS. be given to the world in some shape or other. Mr. Smith gives other 
        evidence to the effect that Mr. Patterson never had a printing office in 
        Pittsburg and that Spaulding never wrote the original "Book of Mormon." 
        He also proves that Rigdon was still a youth, as was Joseph Smith, and 
        that the former was on his father's farm when the copied "Book of 
        Mormon" was first issued. Mr. Smith closes his communication by asking 
        "Hurlburt, for trith's sake, let somebody have that 'Manuscript Found.'" 
        <BR><BR>This morning a L<SMALL>EADER</SMALL> reporter called on Rev. 
        Robert Patterson, a son of the Mr. Patterson, mentioned by Mr. Smith, 
        and interviewed that gentleman of the office of the <I>Presbyterian 
        Banner.</I> <BR><BR>"I have read Mr. Smith's article in the 
        <I>Dispatch,"</I> said he, "and the only question is whether Sidney 
        Rigdon did make a copy of Spaulding's 'Manuscript Found.' My father did 
        run a printing office here, in Pittsburg, about that time. There is no 
        direct proof that Mr. Rigdon made a copy of the work, as is claimed he 
        did. However, the evidence that the Mormon Bible was derived from the 
        'Manuscript Found' has been given over and over again. Mr. Spaulding's 
        old partner at Conneaut, Ohio (Mr. Lake, I think his name was), and 
        numerous other witnesses all testify as to the similarity of many of the 
        names and incidents in Spaulding's 'Manuscript Found' and the 'Book of 
        Mormon.' Two or three of the witnesses are still living <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#040869">Joseph 
        Miller</A>, now an old gentleman of ninety, who lives at Amity, Pa., 
        where Spaulding died, and <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#042169">Reddick 
        McKee, Esq.</A>, of Washington city, who boarded with Mr., Spaulding at 
        Amity, are still living. These two gentlemen and <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#010781">Rev. 
        Abner Jackson</A>, a retured minister of Canton, Ohio, all rememver 
        distinctly the instances of similarity of names and incidents in the 
        'Manuscript Found' and the 'Book of Mormon.' That is simply testimony to 
        show that the Mormon Bible was derived from Spaulding's manuscript. but 
        it does not connect Rigdon with it." <BR><BR>"Then as to Rigdon having 
        been in Pittsburg," continued Mr. Patterson, "and having been about and 
        connected with my father's printing office, I have this to offer. There 
        is <A href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/Eich1879.htm">an old 
        lady</A> still living in Pittsburg, the widow of William Eichbaum, 
        formerly post master of Pittsburg, who distinctly remembers Rigdon, and 
        recollects him as having been an intimate companion of Mr. Lambdin, the 
        partner of Mr. Patterson, and who remembers that Mr. Cyrus [sic] Engle, 
        the foreman of Patterson's printing office, complained of Rigdon's 
        hanging around the office. This is about all the direct testimony I have 
        about Rigdon. As to this man Hulbert, who Mr. Smith claims still retains 
        the manuscripts of Spaulding, I paid him a visit at his home at 
        Gibsonville, Sandusky county, Ohio, in August, 1879, and interviewed him 
        in response to his connection with the Spaulding manuscripts. He said 
        that he did receive the manuscript from the widow of Spaulding in 1834, 
        which manuscript he <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/NEWSP/HOWE/Ex04a.htm#1880">gave to 
        Mr. E. D. Howe</A>, of Painesville, O., but declares his entire 
        ignorance of the contents of that manuscript. He says this was the only 
        Spaulding manuscript he ever had in his possession. <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/NEWSP/HOWE/Ex04a.htm#1879">Mr. Howe 
        states</A> that this manuscript was not the one known as 'Manuscript 
        Found,' but was on an entirely different subject. Those who sustain the 
        view that the Mormon bible was borrowed from Spaulding's Manuscript 
        Found, have made all possible efforts to obtain the copy which Hurlbut 
        was said to possess. There is a contradiction between the story of 
        Rigdon's early life, given by <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/Page1843.htm#pg07c">Corvill 
        Rigdon and Pater Boyer</A>, and the <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/Eich1879.htm">statement of 
        Mrs. Eichbaum</A>&lt; and others. This is about all I have to offer on 
        the subject, but I would suggest that all the readers of the Leader who 
        possess any information on the subject produce it as soon as possible." 
        <BR><BR>A <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1880Dick.htm">recent 
        article</A> in <I>Scribner's Monthly</I> on "The Book of Mormon," 
        written by Miss Ellen E. Dickinson, who claims that Rev. Spaulding was 
        her great uncle, contains among other things the following: Rev. 
        Spaulding, while residing at Conneaut, Ohio, made a study of the ancient 
        mounds in that vicinity, and exhumed many skeletons and relics. This 
        discovery suggested to him the subject of a romance, which he called a 
        translation from some hieroglyphical writings exhumed from mounds. The 
        author called his romance "Manuscript Found," and soon after took it to 
        a Pittsburg printer named Patterson for publication. After keeping it a 
        while the latter returned it, declining to issue the work. Sidney Rigdon 
        at this time frequented Patterson's office. In 1823 Joseph Smith, a 
        disreputable fellow, called on Thurlow Weed, who was then proprietor of 
        a weekly paper at Rochester, N. Y., and asked him to print a manuscript. 
        Weed says, "Smith came from Palmyra, N. Y., and said he had been guided 
        by a vision to a spot, where in a cavern he found a golden Bible. He 
        read the first chapter from a tablet, and I listened until I became 
        tired, and told him to go to a book publisher." Smith's book was finally 
        published, and was nearly identixal with that of Spaulding's manuscript. 
        <BR><BR>Rev. Abner Jackson, an aged minister of Canton, Ohio, published 
        a lengthy communication on the Book of Mormon in the Washington, Pa. 
        <I>Reporter</I> of <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#010781">January 
        12 [7th?]</A>. In this communication Mr. Jackson states that Reverend 
        Spaulding read much of his "Manuscript Found" to his (Jackson's) father, 
        and told him that it was possible that the Indians was descendants of 
        the lost tribes of Israel. "Spaulding," says Jackson "frequently read 
        his book to his neighbors and amused them with it. He wrote it entirely 
        after the style of the Bible." Mr. Jackson further states that when the 
        Mormon Bible of Smith was finally published the neighbors of Spaulding 
        laughed at it and said that Spaulding's manuscript had "come to pass 
        again." They all remembered distinctly the similarity between the 
        passages and selections from the "Book of Mormon" and Spaulding's 
        "Manuscript Found." More testimony regarding the matter is now in order.

        article must have appeared in the <I>Pittsburgh Dispatch</I> around the 
        end of January, 1881. In a Feb. 28, 1881 letter written to anti-Mormon, 
        James T. Cobb, Rev. Robert Patterson, Jr. says, "I mail herewith 
        Pittsburgh 'Dispatch' of this date with your reply to Mr. T. W. 
        Smith..." Thus, it appears that Cobb (then living in Salt Lake City) had 
        sufficient time to receive Smith's article, respond to it, and have his 
        reply received in Pittsburgh well before the end of February, 1881.

      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>Special Correspondence of The Telegraph. 
        <DIV align=right>Mentor, O., January 20. &nbsp; </DIV><BR>"You are in 
        the very cradle of Mormonism here; my farm was once owned by a Mormon," 
        said General Garfield to some visitors, recently, when the Mormon 
        question was broached at his table. The remark led the correspondent of 
        The Telegraph to inquire into some of the facts of the early history of 
        the Latter Day Saints, as they are preserved in the traditions of this 
        historic neighborhood. <BR><BR>Two miles south of General Garfield's 
        residence is the village of Kirtland. Here, in 1830, was a flourishing 
        church of Disciples (then popularly known as Campbellites), of which 
        Elder Sidney Rigdon was the founder and pastor. Rigdon was a very 
        popular preacher, a powerful controversialist, and a master of the 
        English Bible. In the year above named he met Joseph Smith, according to 
        Mormon history, and was immediately converted to the new faith. There is 
        much "Gentile" evidence, however, to the effect that Rigdon was 
        acquainted with Smith for some years previous to 1830, and that he was 
        one of the inventors of the Book of Mormon. That book was published 
        early in the spring of 1830, and soon after the Church of the Latter Day 
        Saints was organized in Ontario county, New York. <BR><BR>In January, 
        1831, Smith visited Rigdon at his residence in Mentor, and the two 
        impostors labored with the Disciples in Kirtland until many of them were 
        converted, and a new church was organized. The new religion caused a 
        great sensation throughout this region, and many converts were made in 
        Mentor and other townships adjacent to Kirtland. The village of Kirtland 
        at once became the first Mormon "Zion," and the "Saints" in the State of 
        New York made haste to sell their property and remove to this place. 
        Their cunning leaders had taken great pains to convert men and women who 
        possessed worldly goods, and the church at Kirtland soon numbered among 
        its members persons of considerable wealth and influence. <BR><BR>The 
        new religionists were full of zeal, and were indefatigable workers. 
        Their preachers overran the surrounding country, and daily made 
        converts. Smith and Rigdon exercised their wits in devising novelities 
        in doctrine, polity and worship, and their followers were fascinated by 
        the mystery and pomp which were introduced. The "Elders" became "Priests 
        after the order of Melchisedek,"and ecclesiastical titles and honors too 
        numerous and absurd to mention fell thick and fast on the faithful from 
        the holy hands of the prophet... <BR><BR>Various kinds of business were 
        established by the saints at Kirtland, including a bank of [sorts?] and 
        a printing house. Smith finished his "inspired translation" of the Old 
        Testament in 1833, although he did not begin the study of Hebrew until 
        nearly three years afterwards, when a Hebrew Professor, having become a 
        convert, a Hebrew professorship was eastablished. Without any knowledge 
        of Greek Smith had made an "inspired translation" of the New Testament, 
        which was completed in February, 1833. As prophet and high priest he had 
        frequent visions of the Savior and the angelsm and received revelations 
        in regard to all the business of his strange community. <BR><BR>The 
        "Bank of Kirtland" is vividly remembered by many of the older citizens 
        of northeastern Ohio. Its "paper money" was issued in large quantities. 
        The volume of currency was [made equal] to the demand of Mormon 
        business, and the business was was extended as far as the currency could 
        be made to go. Lands, cattle, building material and, indeed, all kinds 
        of property were paid for with the notes of the Bank of Kirtland. Of 
        this institution Sidney Rigdon was President and Joseph Smith Cashier. 
        The amount of currency which it issued is not known, but it continued in 
        operation for six years [sic], and then failed under circumstances that 
        made it prudent for the President and Cashier to flee from the State. 
        The failure of the bank caused great distress among thousands of 
        "Gentiles" who had exchanged their property for its notes, and who held 
        the latter as the time of the failure. <BR><BR>The house in which Joseph 
        Smith lived, <BR></SMALL><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Notes:

      <P align=center><B><BIG>Sydney Rigdon Again.</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>To the Editor of The Telegraph. <BR><BR>I read the other 
        evening in The Telegraph the story of T. W. Smith "wherein in justice to 
        history" he corrects "erroneous statements" respecting Sydeny Rigdon and 
        Joe Smith's Mormon Bible made by certain Gentiles. Mr. Smith has not one 
        word to say as to where Joe Smith found his Mormon Bible only that "the 
        church commonly called the Latter Day Saints did not have its beginning 
        in Ontario county, New York." But what, Mr. Smith, about Joe's Bible? Do 
        you deny that it had its origin in Ontario county, N. Y.? Do you deny 
        Sydney Rigdon's oft repeated account of how Joe Smith had the Mormon 
        Bible copied from fourteen gold plates that he pretended to have found 
        in a little stone box burued in a hill in Ontario county, N. Y., to 
        which place he was directed in a trance by the angel Gabriel [sic], and 
        where Sydney assured every one that he found it? Mr. Smith feels bad to 
        think that the Gentiles call Smith and Rigdon impostors, and having read 
        T. W. Smith's statement and compared it with what I heard from Rigdon's 
        own lips, I include T. W. Smith as one also. I send you a copy of The 
        Telegraph in which you published once before <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#082476">a 
        statement</A> of what the writer heard and saw at a public lecture given 
        by Sydeny Rigdon at Meadville, a statement which I think the old folks' 
        association should have a certified copy of placed upon their files, for 
        when a <I>Saint</I> "in justice to history" palms off such a rigmarole, 
        how will it be when sinners have the telling of the story? Sydney's 
        acting of Joe's digging for the box and his astonishment after having it 
        all ready for lifting out; how with all his tugging he was unable to 
        move it; his throwing himself down upon the ground when he recollected 
        that he was there just one year too soon; his filling in the hole and 
        taking back the borrowed tools -- his coming again at a year's time and 
        clearing out the hole till he came again down to the little chest -- 
        when you would have thought by the swing that he gave his arm that the 
        chest about jumped out of the hole itself, -- was rich. When that he 
        described the contents of the 18-inch box, and that it contained 
        fourteen gold plates upon which were written the whole of the Book of 
        Mormon, together with the sword of Gideon and the spectacles of Samuel, 
        and showed us at the end of the Bible the certificates of ten or twelve 
        Mormons whom he assured us had seen the plates as we could see that they 
        had sworn to having seen them. Sydney, I had been told, had been in the 
        habit of palming off a lot of gibberish to ignorant people as being the 
        same as the tongues spoken by the Apostles at the day of Pentecost which 
        the professors and students of Allegheny College having heard of come to 
        the lecture to test Mr. Rigdon, which ended as stated. Sydney was 
        completely caught and I left him with the conviction that he was both a 
        hypocrite and an impostor. &nbsp; &nbsp; R. <BR><BR><BR><FONT

      <P align=center><B><BIG>WASHINGTON &nbsp;COUNTY &nbsp;CENTENNIAL</BIG></B> 
      </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The County of Washington, Pa., will celebrate the centennial 
        anniversary of its organization next week, in the town of Washington, 
        when there is expected to be an immense collection of its present 
        inhabitants and also its sons and daughters from all parts of the United 
        States... <BR><BR>Washington County was organized from a part of 
        Westmoreland in 1781, and was the first of all the numerous counties now 
        bearing that name... 
        <P align=center><B>PREACHERS &nbsp;AND &nbsp;PREACHING</B> </P>The early 
        ministers of the gospel in this county were a class of superior men, 
        noted for ability, piety and force of character. The impress made by 
        them upon society is felt and seen to this day and extends to the 
        Pacific coast and even to heathen lands. Their preaching powers were of 
        a very high order and were greatly blessed of God. The sermons delivered 
        by them in private houses, in the woods and in the rude log churches 
        were in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, They were the ardent 
        friends of education and the vigorous opponents of all forms of evil. 
        During the madness of the "Whiskey Insurrection" most of them denounced 
        it, and they were not afraid to speak and labor for the defeat of 
        candidates for public office whom they considered unworthy. The names of 
        McMillan, Dod, Smith, Marquis, Patterson, Finley and others will be in 
        everlasting remembrance; while it is impossible for us to mention in 
        this article the great number of ministers of the gospel reared in this 
        county or educated there who have gone into all parts of the world to 
        make known the glad tidings of salvation. The churches of this county 
        have been visited by frequent and powerful revivals of religion. The 
        great revival of 1802 which swept over Western Pennsylvania and which 
        had begun in Kentucky and Tennessee under the preaching of James 
        McGready, a former pupil of Dr, McMillan, manifested itself first at the 
        church of Three Springs, a part of the charge of Elisha McCurdy, in 
        September, 1802. Rev. Thomas Campbell, who had been a member of the 
        General Associate Synod of Scotland and had been received a member of 
        the Associate Presbytery of Chartiers, and his now distinguished son 
        Alexander Campbell, organized the denomination now known as "Disciples," 
        by forming two congregations, one at Cross Roads, six miles northwest of 
        the town of Washington, and the other at Brush Run, eight miles 
        southwest of the same place. In the Fall of 1831 Revs. A. M. Bryan, John 
        Morgan, R. Burrow, and R. Dunnell, upon the invitation of a few persons 
        disaffected towards the church of Ten Mile, came as "missionaries" to 
        proclaim the doctrines of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. The grave 
        of the Rev. S<SMALL>OLOMON</SMALL> S<SMALL>PAULDING</SMALL>, author of 
        the romance entitled "Manuscript Found," which was seized and published 
        as the "Book of Mormon," upon which the whole Mormon delusion has been 
        built by S<SMALL>IDNEY</SMALL> R<SMALL>IGDON</SMALL>, J<SMALL>OE</SMALL> 
        S<SMALL>MITH</SMALL> and others, is in the village of Amity, in this 
        county, where he died in 1816... <BR><BR><FONT color=maroon 
        size=3><BR>Note: It may seem rather strange that the name of Solomon 
        Spalding would be brought forth and mentioned among the prominent past 
        religious figures of Washington county. However, interest in preserving 
        the Spalding gravesite at Amity had been alive in the county since <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#021479">early 
        1879</A>. Eventually Spalding's headstone was replaced with a permanent 
        stone marker and memory of the would-be writer was kept from fading 
        completely away. No doubt the rising feelings against the Mormons during 
        that time provided the local incentive to demonstrate some pride in the 
        fact that the "author of the romance entitled 'Manuscript Found'" was 
        buried in Washington county and that the story of his life and writings 
        provided a possible antidote to pernicious "Mormonism."

      <P align=center><B><BIG>THE &nbsp;MORMON &nbsp;MONSTROSITY.</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Public attention is now directed, in a degree never 
        heretofore equaled, to the growing abomination of polygamy in Utah. This 
        increase of interest is easily accounted for, by the amazing rapidity 
        with which this iniquity has been recently extending and by the insolent 
        daring with which the Mormons continue in the most open way to violate 
        the natural laws and to defy the power of the national Government. The 
        mass of our people are incensed not only with this new rebellion, but 
        also with the shameful truckling with which politicians of both parties 
        have yielded to Mormon arrogance. <BR><BR>The present is an opportune 
        moment for a brief sketch of their peculiar system of polygamy as 
        defined by the Mormons themselves. It is well known that the Book of 
        Mormon itself gives no countenance to polygamy; on the contrary it 
        condemns the practice. Also, in their book of Doctrine and Covenants 
        (section 49), occurs a revelation through Joseph Smith to Rigdon, Pratt, 
        and Copley, who were sent from Kirtland, O., in March, 1831, on a 
        mission to the Shakers, whose anti-marriage vuews are notorious, in 
        which revelation it is affirmed that "whoso forbiddeth to marry is not 
        ordained of God unto man; wherefore it is lawful that he <I>should have 
        one wife and they twain shall be one flesh."</I> By a previous 
        revelation to Smith at Kirtland, Feb. 9, 1831, it was commanded: "Thou 
        shalt love <I>thy wife</I> with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto 
        <I>her and none else."</I> <BR><BR>But with that proclivity, which not 
        unfrequently distinguishes errorists, to go from bad to worse, the 
        Mormon prophet himself soon lapsed from his original standard and, on 
        the evidence of his own followers, was guilty both of attempted and 
        actual violations of his marriage vows. In 1838 he had persuaded several 
        women to become his "spiritual wives," as he euphemistically expressed 
        it, but under which term was included (to adopt the phraseology of the 
        Beecher trial) "all that the word implies." So flagrant became the 
        cirminal practices of himself and some of his subordinates that a number 
        of his adherents renounced Mormonism on this very account at Nauvoo, 
        Ill., in 1844, and commenced the publication of a paper, called "The 
        Expositor," to reveal his licentiousness. In the first number they 
        printed the affidavits of sixteen women, certifying the attempts of 
        Smith, Rigdon [sic], and others to seduce them under the plea of a 
        special commission from heaven <BR><BR>On May 6th, 1844, a mob composed 
        of Smith and his friends demolished the Expositor office for its daring 
        revelations, thus confessing their guilt. For this they were prosecuted, 
        and having resisted the ordinary legal process, were arrested by the 
        militia under the call of the Governor and were lodged in the jail at 
        Carthage. Here the same mob violence to which they had resorted was in 
        turn visited upon themselves, and on June 27th, 1844, the jail was 
        attacked by a lawless band, and Joseph and Hyrum Smith were shot. Thus 
        the murder of these two Mormon leaders, though an inexcusable outrage, 
        was directly traceable to their licentious practices. (See Appleton's 
        Cyclopedia, title: Mormonism). <BR><BR>So great was the public outcry 
        against the alleged Mormon laxity, that in 1845 the Mormon leaders 
        published the following emphatic denial of both the doctrine and the 
        practice. <BR><BR>"Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached 
        with the crimes of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe 
        that one man should have but one wife, and one woman but one husband; 
        except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again." 
        <BR><BR>Notwithstanding these implicit declarations, Brigham Young 
        proclaimed, August 29th, 1852, a "celestial law of marriage," 
        sanctioning polygamy, which he declared had been revealed to Joseph 
        Smith at Nauvoo, July 12th, 1843. Smith's widow and his four sons at 
        once denounced this revelation as a forgery and headed a schism from the 
        Utah body which still continues, the headquarters of the non-polygamist 
        Mormons being at Plano, a small town in Illinois. The vast majority of 
        the Mormons, however, have accepted the polygamous revelation as of 
        divine authority, despite its manifest inconsistency with preceding 
        alleged inspired declarations. This "celestial law" occupies eleven 
        pages of the book of "Doctrine and Covenants." From this disgusting 
        production -- the inspiration of a depraved heart -- we make the 
        following extract: <BR><BR><SMALL>"If any man espouse a virgin, and 
        desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he 
        espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other 
        man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given 
        unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto 
        him and to no one else; and if he have ten virgins given unto him by 
        this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they 
        are given unto him; therefore is he justified. But if one or either of 
        the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man; she 
        has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto 
        him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, 
        and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the 
        foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, 
        that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father 
        continued, that he may be glorified." <BR></SMALL><BR>This hideous 
        statute, which is the foundation of Mormon polygamy, is intriduced with 
        this blasphemous assumption: <BR><BR><SMALL>"Behold! I reveal unto you a 
        new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then 
        are ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to 
        enter into my glory.... he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and 
        shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God." 
        <BR></SMALL><BR>It may well be doubted whether, in all the history of 
        imposture, a more frightful and destestable instance of a pretender 
        arrogating to himself the solemn office of being the oracle of God, can 
        be found than that presented by this miserable wretch, his own hands 
        dripping with the blood of his countless victims, his own heart 
        festering with the most loathsome corruption, yet presuming to hurl upon 
        all who opposed him the anathemas of the Almighty, whose holy law he was 
        perpetually trampling under his feat. Yet the Government of the United 
        States stoped so low as to concillare this beastly tyrant by appointing 
        him the first Governor of Utah for four years, from 1850 to 1854; and 
        when he subsequently rebelled against and defied the national authority, 
        necessitating the sending of a force of two thousand five hundred men in 
        1857 to support that authority, our Government stooped again to 
        compromise with an armed rebel, and weakly nursed the viper it should 
        have utterly crushed. <BR><BR>Another rebellion in Utah is now in 
        progress and it remains to be seen whether our readers have learned 
        wisdom from the lessons of the past. <BR><FONT color=maroon

        Mormonism</A> will not be ready for distribution before Feb. 25th. This 
        delay is occasioned by a delay in getting paper from the East. The book 
        is now in press, and the Hoe Cylinder is working day and night on the 
        first edition of 20,000 copies. Orders are coming in from all parts of 
        the country. These will be filled in the order of their reception. Those 
        wishing the book should send in their orders as soon as possible. A 
        second edition will follow the first as soon as necessary, <BR><BR>It 
        has been suggested that a copy of the book be put on the desk of each 
        legislator of the country, both State and National, by the Christian 
        women of the country. This will require some 5000 copies. If 2500 women 
        will send to J. M. Coyner or Rev. R. G. McNiece, Salt Lake City, one 
        dollar each, two copies will be sent to the donor and the other two will 
        be used as above suggested, or any other amount donated will be used in 
        the same way at 25 cents a copy. If 5000 copies of the Hand-Book can be 
        placed immediately in the hands of the law makers of the land it will do 
        much to give the right directions to public opinion. Will the press 
        please publish this notice?

      <BLOCKQUOTE>Redick McKee, Esq., well known to many of our older readers 
        in Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia, writes for us, Nov. 6th, from 
        Washington, D. C., where he has been residing for a few years past, a 
        private letter, from which we make the following extracts which have a 
        general interest. 
        <P align=center>T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> D<SMALL>AUGHTER OF</SMALL> 
        S<SMALL>OLOMAN</SMALL> S<SMALL>PAULDING.</SMALL> </P><SMALL>"On Tuesday 
        last (Oct. 31st) I visited Mrs. McKinstry at the house of her 
        son-in-law, Col. Seaton, and found her an intelligent, active, healthy 
        woman, now in her 77th year. She appeared highly gratified at meeting 
        with me after a separation of 66 or 67 years. Her recollections of early 
        incidents at Amity, where we met daily during the almost two years I 
        boarded in her father's family, are very fresh in her mind, and she 
        recalled many little occurrences which have escaped my memory. Once was 
        my giving her her first horseback ride, sitting behind me, &amp;c. 
        <BR><BR>"The only thing in relation to the lost 'Manuscript' within her 
        recollection of which you have not already learned is her remembering to 
        have heard her mother say that, before they left Pittsburgh, she 
        accompanied her husband to the store of Mr. Patterson and heard a 
        conversation in relation to the publication of the 'Manuscript.' There 
        were two Mr. Pattersons present, one an elderly gentleman, with a 
        remarkably mild, pleasant countenance, and much more robust than the 
        other. The more slender Mr. Patterson told Mr. Spaulding that he had 
        read several chapters of the 'Manuscript' and was struck favorably with 
        its curious descriptions and its likeness to the ancient style of the 
        Old Testament Scriptures. He thought it would be well to publish it, as 
        it would attract attention and meet with a ready sale. He suggested, 
        however, that Mr. Spaulding should write a brief preface, and perhaps a 
        chapter or two in concluding the romance, giving a little more elaborate 
        description of the Indian mounds in Ohio. Her mother thought he was 
        engaged in doing that at the time I was living with the family at Amity. 
        This is confirmatory of my own recollections." <BR></SMALL><BR>The above 
        reminiscence is important on account of its clearing up one of the 
        difficulties connected with the history of the Spaulding manuscript. The 
        widow of Mr. Spaulding, in a letter <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NE/miscne01.htm#041939">published 
        in 1839</A>, had stated that "Mr. Patterson was very much pleased with 
        it (the story) and borrowed it for perusal; he retained it for a long 
        time and informed Mr. Spaulding that if he would make out a title page 
        and preface, he would publish it and it might be a source of profit." 
        Rev. R. Patterson, in a brief certificate published <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1842Wilm.htm#pg16b">in 
        1842</A>, states that he "read only a few pages," and appears to have 
        had no very definite knowledge of the story. At the time of Mr. 
        Spaulding's residence in Pittsburgh, the two brothers were carrying on 
        the bookselling and publishing business under the firm name R. &amp; J. 
        Patterson. The description given above of the one who had read several 
        chapters and advised its publication shows that it was Joseph Patterson, 
        Esq., who did this, and the seeming inconsistency in the statements of 
        Mr. Spaulding's widow and Mr. R. Patterson is accounted for." <BR><FONT 
        color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note: Here the elderly Redick McKee updates 
        his previous correspondence of <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1882PatA.htm#pg429b">April 15, 
        1879</A> to Robert Patterson, Jr. on the same subject matter. McKee's 
        solicitation of this information from the adopted daughter of Solomon 
        Spalding serves the important purpose highlighted by Robert Patterson, 
        Jr., when he says that it accounts for the "seeming inconsistency in the 
        statements of Mr. Spaulding's widow and Mr. R. Patterson" (the father of 
        Robert Patterson, Jr.). McKee was instrumental in reviving public 
        interest in the Spalding authorship claims, beginning with the letter he 
        saw published <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#042169">in

      <P align=center><B><BIG>THE &nbsp;MORMON &nbsp;CELEBRATION.</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The village of Kirtland, Lake County, Ohio, is now the scene 
        of a large gathering of that portion of Mormons who repudiate polygamy 
        and other abominations of the Utah branch. Kirtland became, in 1830, the 
        headquarters of the Mormon delusion, and continued to be their centre of 
        operations until the hostility of the surrounding population, occasioned 
        by the dishonest practices of the Mormon leaders, compelled them to seek 
        a home elsewhere. In 1834 Independence, Mo., was selected as the site 
        for the Mormon Zion; in 1835 Joseph Smith disposed of the greater part 
        of his Kirtland property, but seems not to have abandoned that place 
        until January, 1838, when he and Sidney Rigdon, having been arrested on 
        charges of swindling, escaped by night from the sheriff and fled on 
        horseback to Missouri, (Tucker's Origin of Mormonism, p. 155.) During 
        their stay at Kirtland, the Mormons erected their first temple, at a 
        cost of about $50,000, and in this long deserted tabernacle their 
        followers are now holding their reunion. It is reported that a recent 
        decision of a lawsuit has settled the title to this property in the 
        Latter Day Saints, and it is added that they now propose to hold it 
        permanently and use it as a place for an annual convention. <BR><BR>The 
        day for the opening of the present celebration, April 6th, was selected 
        because on that date in 1830, the Mormon Church, as its adherents are 
        fond of calling it, was organized and established at Harmony, 
        Susquehanna Co., Pa. [sic], among a few members of the Smith family and 
        their neighbors. It had but a feeble existence until Sidney Rigdon, a 
        few months afterwards, professed conversion to its faith and became its 
        leading spirit. He was at that time ministering to a congregation of 
        Disciples (Campbellites) at Kirtland, and drew with him a large portion 
        of his flock. Thus Kirtland became the Mecca of this new delusion, and 
        there its 53d anniversary is being celebrated. <BR><BR>The recognized 
        head of this branch of the Mormons is Joseph Smith, of Plano, Ill., a 
        son of the founder of Mormonism. His official title is President of the 
        Church of Latter Day Saints. He delivered the opening address at the 
        exercises on the 6th inst., and was followed by W. W. Blair and Z. H. 
        Gurley, prominent officials. All of the speakers eulogized Joseph Smith, 
        the Prophet, and denounced as strongly as any non-Mormon could do, the 
        polygamous enormities in Utah. <BR><BR>On the succeeding days, up to the 
        present, addresses similar in tone to these, and full of confidence as 
        to the future of pure Mormonism, have been delivered to audiences 
        variously reported as from two hundred to five hundred, comprising 
        delegates from all parts of the United States and Territories. The 
        little town of about three hundred inhabitants is reported to have 
        suddenly increased its numbers to nearly one thousand. The assemblage is 
        an important one as showing the strength and vitality of one of the most 
        transparent delusions in all the history of superstition and imposture.

      <P align=center><B><BIG>THE &nbsp;BOOK &nbsp;OF &nbsp;MORMON.</BIG></B> 
      </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The authorship of the historical portions of the Book of 
        Mormon has been attributed by all except Mormons themselves to Rev. 
        S<SMALL>OLOMON</SMALL> S<SMALL>PAULDING</SMALL>, who composed it as a 
        romance purporting to give the origin and history of the Indians of this 
        continent, Mr. Spaulding came to Pittsburgh in 1812 and remained until 
        1814, for the express purpose of effecting the publication of his story, 
        but in this attempt was unsuccessful. He died at Amity, Washington 
        County, Pa., in 1816. What became of his manuscript is a question which 
        has occasioned no small discussion. The prevailing belief is that 
        S<SMALL>IDNEY</SMALL> R<SMALL>IGDON</SMALL>, one of the earliest Mormon 
        leaders, and the most successful in gaining adherents for this imposture 
        at its introduction, had obtained possession of Mr. Spaulding's 
        manuscript, altered it in some places to suit his purposes, and added to 
        it largely from his own erratic theological opinions, thus forming the 
        Book of Mormon. <BR><BR>In support of this theory a large amount of 
        circumstantial and corroborative testimony has been accumulated and 
        widely published in books, pamphlets, and newspapers. But until recently 
        the evidence of only one witness, the late Rev. <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1882PatA.htm#pg434b">John 
        Winter</A>, of Sharon, Pa., attested Rigdon's own admission that he had 
        Spaulding's manuscript.To this we are now enabled to add the unequivocal 
        declaration of another unimpeachable witness, Mr. J<SMALL>AS</SMALL>. 
        J<SMALL>EFFERY</SMALL>, of Churchville, Md. For obtaining this testimony 
        we are indebted ti Isaac Craig, Esq., of Allegheny, who has for years 
        interested himself deeply in the origin of the Book of Mormon, and by an 
        extensive correspondence has enlisted others in the same investigation, 
        of which the following testimony is the latest fruit: 
<BR><BR><BR><SMALL>
        <P align=center><B>STATEMENT &nbsp;OF &nbsp;JAMES &nbsp;JEFFERY</B>. 
        </P>I know more about the Mormons than any man east of the Alleghenies, 
        although I have given no attention to the matter for twenty-five years. 
        I did not know I was in possession of any information concerning the 
        Book of Mormon unknown to others. I supposed that as Rigdon was so open 
        with me, he had told others the same things. <BR><BR>Forty years ago I 
        was in business in St. Louis. The Mormons then had their temple in 
        Nauvoo, Ill. I had business transactions with them. Sidney Rigdon I knew 
        very well. He was general manager of the affairs of the Mormons. 
        <BR><BR>Rigdon, in hours of conversation told me a number of times there 
        was in the printing office with which he was connected in Ohio, a 
        manuscript of Rev. Spaulding, tracing the origin of the Indian race from 
        the lost tribes of Israel; that this manuscript was in the office for 
        several years; that he was familiar with it; that Spaulding had wanted 
        it printed, but had not the money to pay for the printing; that he 
        (Rigdon) and Joe Smith used to look over the manuscript and read it over 
        Sundays. <BR><BR>Rigdon and Smith took the manuscript and said -- "I'll 
        print it," and went off to Palmyra, N. Y. <BR><BR>I never knew the 
        information was of any importance -- thought others were aware of these 
        facts. I do not now think the matter is of any importance. It will not 
        injure Mormonism. That is an "ism," and chimes in with the wishes of 
        certain classes of people. Nothing will put it down but the strong arm 
        of the law. Otherwise it will go on forever, like Tennyson's "Brook." 
        <BR><BR>This is the substance of what I remember about the matter.

        I<SMALL>SAAC</SMALL> C<SMALL>RAIG</SMALL>: -- <I>Dear Sir --</I> I 
        enclose you a copy of the information which Mr. James Jeffery gave to me 
        about the origin of the Book of Mormon. It is in my handwriting. I wrote 
        verbatim at his dictation, in the presence of Dr. Finney and Mrs. 
        Jeffery. Mr. Jeffery read and signed the paper, as did also Dr. Finney 
        and Mrs. Jeffery. <BR><BR>Mr. Jeffery, in recounting to me various 
        phases of his life, happened to hit on his acquaintance with the Mormons 
        years ago. I have read <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1882PatA.htm">the pamphlet</A> 
        of Mr. Patterson which you gave me last summer, saw at once that Mr. 
        Jeffery was a likely man to question. So I asked him about his 
        conversations with Rigdon, and found he was in possession of what seemed 
        to me the information you and Mr. Patterson have been seeking. 
        <BR><BR>Mr. Jeffery insists that Rigdon said the manuscript was in the 
        printing office in <I>Ohio.</I> He could not recall the locality. So it 
        is probable Mr. Patterson, Sr., was correct, as stated in <A

        Disciples of Christ publication, early in 1884. It was probably from 
        such a source that Rev. Clark Braden derived his Feb. 1884 <A

        version</A> of the Jeffery statement. <BR><BR>Note 3: In her lame 
        attempt to refute the Jeffery statement, Fawn M. Brodie says that 
        "Rigdon never lived in St. Louis..." James Jeffery can be documented 
        from contemporary evidence as having been a merchant in St. Louis during 
        the mid-1840s. Rigdon did not have to live in that city to visited there 
        after his excommunication trial at Nauvoo on <A 
        href="http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n18.htm#664">Sept. 2, 
        1844</A>. In that trial he publicly threatened to expose "the secrets" 
        of the Mormons: "'Brother Sidney says, "if we go to opposing him he will 
        tell all of our secrets!'" Apostle Orson Hyde followed Rigdon from 
        Nauvoo to St. Louis and on <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/Hyd1845A.htm#9-12-44">Sept. 12th</A> 
        wrote to Brigham Young that he observed Rigdon in the company of a 
        gentile merchant named "Clapp." Hyde also wrote on Sep. 16th to Young 
        that Rigdon was spouting off in St. Louis, bragging that he had evidence 
        that would have toppled Smith from religious power years before, had he 
        exposed the activities of the late Mormon leader earlier: "Rigdon 
        claimed in St. Louis to be "in possession of facts and power 
        [sufficient] to have hurled Joseph from his station long ago." Rigdon 
        then published a letter in the <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/Hyd1845A.htm#9-12-Rig">Sept. 16, 
        1844</A> issue of St. Louis <I>Peoples Organ,</I> saying that Hyde 
        "feared disclosures" Rigdon might make and was readying his henchmen in 
        St. Louis to "commit violence on my person." On <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/Hyd1845A.htm#11-16-44">Nov. 16, 
        1844</A> the Mormon paper in New York City, <I>The Prophet,</I> reported 
        that Rigdon had denied Mormonism while he was in St. Louis: "while in 
        Missouri, he... pronounced Mormonism to be a delusion." These documented 
        circumstances surrounding the excommunicated Rigdon appear to be 
        precisely such circumstances as would have induced him to begin 
        divulging Mormon "secrets" in St. Louis. It is possible that Rigdon was 
        attempting to preserve his life in a delicate balancing act, whereby he 
        demonstrated his willingness expose a few Mormon "secrets" (to leading 
        Missourians like merchant James Jeffery) but kept other secrets hidden, 
        as a valuable bargaining chip against Hyde's alleged plan to have him 
        murdered. <BR><BR>Note 4: Fawn M. Brodie also says: "nor did Joseph 
        Smith ever visit Ohio before 1831." How she can be so certain of that 
        fact is unfathomable. It would have only taken one secret visit by Smith 
        to see Rigdon in Ohio, to provided a basis for Jeffery's statement. 
        However, Rigdon may have negelected to tell Jeffery that it was through 
        the auspices of a middleman (like pedestrian peddlers Oliver Cowdery and 
        Parley P. Pratt) that a copy of the much revised Spalding epic was taken 
        "to Palmyra" so that Smith could "print it." The one element is the 
        Jeffery statement which seems the least likely is that a Spalding 
        mansucript was left unattended in an Ohio printing office. That much of 
        his statement may well have been a mistaken memory.

      &nbsp;OF <BR>THE &nbsp;MORMON &nbsp;BIBLE.</B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>It will be remembered by our readers that just previous to 
        the commencement of the debate with Rev. McVey on the Mormon question, 
        Rev. W. R. Coovert stated to a <I>Leader</I> reporter that Sidney 
        Rigdon, a former resident of Pittsburg, had stolen the manuscript of the 
        Mormon Bible, which had been written by a Doctor Spaulding, of Ohio, as 
        a romance and which the latter had left with a publisher named 
        Patterson, father of the editor of the Presbyterian Banner; that after 
        stealing it he submitted it to Joseph Smith, of Palmyra, N. Y., who, in 
        connection with Rigdon, published it and palmed it off as a revelation 
        from God. <BR><BR>Learning that a daughter of Rigdon was living in 
        Pittsburg, a reporter called on her yesterday, and at first she declined 
        to say anything at all on the subject, but finally, on the scribe 
        promising not to use her name -- she is married -- she said: "I have 
        never had the honor of seeing this so-called Rev. Coovert, who of late 
        has been so free in his use of dead men's names, but I understand he 
        parts his hair in the middle of his head, a fact which, from what I have 
        heard and read of him, is no surprise to me. Now, while I most 
        emphatically decline to be drawn into any controversy over that story of 
        Coovert, which if there was any foundation for it, I can not for the 
        life of me, see why it was allowed to remain quiet for years after all 
        the actors are laid in their graves; yet I will say this, that my 
        father, who had the respect of all who knew him, and at a time when he 
        had but little hope of living from one day to another, said to the 
        clergymen around him, of which there was a number belonging to various 
        denominations: these were his words: "As I expect to die and meet my 
        Maker, I know nothing about where the manuscript of the Mormon Bible 
        came from." <BR><BR>The lady said further that she believed as firmly as 
        she "believed anything, that Joseph Smith (who was, she believed, at one 
        time a good man) had a revelation, and that the Mormon Bible was founded 
        on that revelation. But she was satisfied the Rev. Coovert had never 
        seen a copy of it and consequently did not know what he was talking and 
        writing about." <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Notes:

      <BR>____ <BR><BR><SMALL>Leaves From the History of Little Washington -- 
      Origin of the <BR>Mormon Bible -- Written by a Washington County Preacher. 
      </SMALL></B></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL>Little Washington, the capital of the wool county, 
        has quite a history. The original name of this town was Bassettown, and 
        it originally belonged to Strabane township, one, of the thirteen 
        original townships of the county, created in 1781. Washington county was 
        the first county formed by the legislature of Pennsylvania after the 
        Declaration of Independence had been promulgated to all nations and 
        Pennsylvania had assumed her rank and place as a free and Independent 
        state, and hence it was named after immortal Washington. The name of the 
        town was changed permanently to Washington on the 4th of November, 1784, 
        the date at which the second plot of the town was made. A small stream 
        running through the southern and western portion of the town bears the 
        name of Catfish run. On this ground was the camp of Chief Catfish. The 
        stream, the land and the town all derived their name from this 
        celebrated chief whose Indian name was Tingroegua, He belonged to the 
        Kuskuskee tribe of Indians and occupied the hunting grounds between the 
        Allegheny mountains and the Ohio rivor. Catfish was present and made a 
        speech at the conference held in Philadelphia, December 4th, 1789, at 
        which Governor Hamilton and his council, with chiefs from Wyoming, 
        Delaware and Kuskuskee Indians were present. <BR>
        <P align=center><SMALL>FAMOUS &nbsp;WASHINGTONIANS.</SMALL> </P>Among 
        the original lot-holders was Robert Fulton, of steamboat notoriety. He 
        held three lots In this town. The site where Washington stands was in 
        1782 a vast thicket of red and black hawthornes, wild plums, hazel 
        bushes, scrub oaks and briars. The whole coimtry was a dense forest, 
        only broken by small patches of dead trees, made so by the axe of the 
        early pioneer. Washington is situated near the centre of the county, on 
        the national road from Philadelphia to Wheeling, twenty-four miles from 
        Brownsville and thirty-two miles from Wheeling, twenty-seven miles from 
        Pittsburg and twenty-two miles from Monongahela City. Its situation is 
        salubrious and from the local position adopted to become a manufacturing 
        centre. Bituminous coal underlies the town and valley. No county in the 
        state of Pennsylvania or probably in the United States can boast of a 
        purer, better, more intelligent and devoted company of Christians than 
        those who first settled Washington connty. The first settlers were 
        composed of the Scotch-Irish element, those who emigrated from the west 
        of Scotland and the north of Ireland, while many others came from 
        Cumberland and York counties, where the sume element prevailed. Those 
        early pioneers of a hundred years ago crossed the rugged steeps of the 
        Allegheny mountains, the turbulent waves of the swift-flowing rivers and 
        penetrated into an unknown wilderness to secure the blessings of civil 
        and religious liberty. <BR>
        <P align=center><SMALL>THE &nbsp;BOOK &nbsp;OF &nbsp;MORMON.</SMALL> 
        </P>It is beyond the possibility of a doubt that the Book of Mormon was 
        originally written in this county. The village of Amity, in all coming 
        time may be regarded as the Mecca of Mormonism. Dr. Alfred Creigh, in <A 
        href="http://solomonspalding.com/Lib/Cre1870a.htm">his history</A> of 
        Washington county, gives an accurate account of this most stupendous 
        imposture, which has been perpetrated for centuries; but more especially 
        upon so intelligent a nation as the American people -- an imposture at 
        which the religious world stands amazed. It was in thee year of 1816 
        [sic - 1814] that Rev. Solomon Spaulding, a graduate of Dartmouth 
        college, settled in Amity, with a view to banish ennui. He was an 
        antiquarian and traveled far and near to investigate scientifically 
        Indian mounds and everything else connected with American antiquities, 
        for the purpose of tracing the aborigines to their original source, a 
        portion of one of the lost tribes of ancient Israel. While pursuing 
        these investigations and to wile away the tedious hours he wrote a 
        romance based upon fiction, his investigations and history, at the same 
        time leaving the reader under the impression that it was found in one of 
        these mounds and through his knowledge of hieroglyphics he had 
        deciphered it. As times and circumstances would permit he would often 
        read to his friends in Amity portions of his fabulous and historical 
        romance. <BR>
        <P align=center><SMALL>SIDNEY &nbsp;RIGDON.</SMALL> </P>Spaulding 
        resolved to publish it under the name of "The Manuscript Found" and 
        actually entered into a contract with a Pittsburg publisher named 
        Patterson, to publish the same, but from some cause the contract was not 
        fulfilled. The manuscript remained in the possession of Patterson for 
        two or three years before SpauUling reclaimed it. In the meantime a 
        journeyman printer of the name of Sidney Rigden copied the whole of the 
        manuscript and hearing of Joseph Smilh's digging operations for money 
        through the instrumentality of necromancy resolved in his own mind that 
        he would turn this wonderful manuscript to good account and make it 
        profitable to himself. An interview took place between Rigdon and Smith, 
        terms were agreed upon, the whole manuscript underwent a partial 
        revision and in process of time, instead of finding money, they found 
        curious plates, which when translated turned out to be the Golden Bible 
        or Book of Mormon. But the testimony of living witnesses, whose 
        characters are beyond reproach, place the question beyond the 
        possibility of a doubt thatt the Book of Mormon was originally written 
        by Rev. Solomon Spaulding. <BR></SMALL><FONT color=maroon

      OHIO. </SMALL></B></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>E<SMALL>DITORS</SMALL> B<SMALL>ANNER</SMALL>: -- Mr. E. R. 
        Perkins, of Cleveland, in a late issue of the Leader, says: "Mormonism 
        claims to believe the Bible and the Book of Mormon." Had Mr. Perkins 
        said Mormonism pretends to receive the Bible, but receives the Book of 
        Mormon as the Word of God, he would have hit the matter. Proof that the 
        Mormons do not receive the Bible as the Word of God: The first witness I 
        adduce is W. W. Blair, a prominent Mormon elder and author. He says, in 
        a book called "Joseph the Seer," published by the Board of Publication 
        of the Reorganized Churst of Christ: "The evident object in giving what 
        is called the Inspired Translation, was to relieve the Scriptures of 
        gross and harmful errors of doctrine, morals, history, and to restore 
        valluable portions that have been taken away." One joint of a turkey's 
        leg is enough to show whether the animal is tainted. But Joseph Smith in 
        the history of his Church, written shortly before his death says: "We 
        believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated 
        correctly." We see from this that the Mormon elders who preach from our 
        Bible or Testament are deceiving the people by withholding truth. Should 
        they tell the people when on their preaching tours that they reject our 
        Bible when they get to Utah, but few would be humbugged. But they take a 
        text from the New Testament mostly, I preach "Faith, repentance and 
        baptism by immersion for the remission of sins," with all the zeal of an 
        Alexander Campbell. Had Mr. Campbell never beem born Mormonism never 
        would have cursed this world. <BR><BR><BR><FONT color=maroon 
        size=3>Note: Rev. Hench equates the Latter Day Saint promotion of 
        "Faith, repentance and baptism by immersion for the remission of sins," 
        as being the equivalent of early Campbellite doctrine. This same 
        argument has been made, in detail, by other writers. The possibility 
        here appears to be that the Rev. Sidney Rigdon carried over a 
        considerable amount of Campbellite terminology and practice with him 
        when he joined the Mormons in late 1830. If this is true, as it 
        certainly must be, the question remaining to be answered is, "how did 
        such "Campbellite" tenets come to be written into the Book of Mormon, 
        which was published months before Rigdon joined the Saints?"

      </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Philadelphia, PA., Aug. 12 -- Elder Stewart, the 
        Philadelphia missionary of the Anti-Polygamist Church of the Latter Day 
        Saints, states that the original and long-lost manuscript of the 
        Scriptural novel written by Rev. Mr. Spaulding has been found. It was 
        from this manuscript that rumor declared that the Book of Mormon was 
        written, instead of being translated, as was alleged, from the golden 
        plates mysteriously delivered to the "Prophet" Smith by the "angel." The 
        manner of discovery was most simple. The publisher to whom the reverend 
        novelist's production was offered had laid the manuscript aside, not 
        deeming it likely to prove remunerative as an investment for his spare 
        cash to give the work to the public. <BR><BR>In course of time it was 
        deposited, the account says, in a chest, with a number of other MSS., 
        the supposed inherent qualities of which consigned them to oblivion like 
        itself. Recently the stock, good will and fixtures of the place were 
        sold out, and in overhauling the chest in question this manuscript, with 
        Spaulding's signature, came to light. It is now at Oberlin College., and 
        as the "Saints"claim that it is in every particular totally unlike the 
        Book of Mormon, they propose to print and publish it at an early day, 
        that the world may see that the volume on which their religion claims to 
        be based may have had a different origin from that which has long been 
        popularly ascribed to it. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note: It 
        is rather extraordinary that the copy writer for a major Pittsburgh 
        newspaper could allow such an error-ridden report to appear, with no 
        corrections, before the public scrutiny. Certainly, as late as 1885, 
        there were still many old residents of that city who recalled more 
        accurate accounts of the fate of Mr. Spalding's writings.

      <P align=center><B><BIG>Spaulding's &nbsp;"Manuscript 
      &nbsp;Found."</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Rev. Sereno E. Bishop, of Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, in a 
        contribution to the Independent of <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NY/nyin1880.htm#091085">the 
        10th inst.</A>, states that a manuscript romance from the pen of Rev. 
        S<SMALL>OLOMON</SMALL> S<SMALL>PAULDING</SMALL> has been discovered at 
        Honolulu. The manuscript is attested by the signature of D. P. Hurlbut, 
        the man who in 1834 rifled the trunk of Mr. Spaulding's widow of all its 
        manuscript contents save one unfinished story. The circumstances 
        attending this discovery seem to leave no room for doubt that this is a 
        veritable Spaulding document; and its contents, as reported by Mr. 
        Bishop, show that it has no connection with "The Book of Mormon." This 
        brief statement comprises all that Mr. Bishop's article adds to our 
        previous knowledge of the origin of Mormonism. <BR><BR>From these 
        premises Mr. Bishop derives the conclusion that this is the "famous lost 
        manuscript of Solomon Spaulding" which "has obtained its very 
        considerable celebrity as being the supposed original document from 
        which the Book of Mormon was in part derived;" and he regards it as his 
        "privilege to announce that this long lost and noted document has been 
        discovered in Honolulu." <BR><BR>His premises do not warrant his 
        conclusion. At least fifteen unimpeached <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1882PatA.htm">witnesses</A>, 
        three of whom are still living, have testified to the identity of many 
        of the names and incidents in the Book of Mormon with those with which 
        they became familiar from hearing Mr. Spaulding read his story, the 
        "Manuscript Found." That the Honolulu document does not bear this title 
        and does not contain these names and incidents, proves clearly that it 
        is not the same story; but certainly does not prove, in the face of such 
        an array of testimony, the Spaulding never wrote such a romance 
        <BR><BR>Again, it is well known by those who know anything of Mr. 
        Spaulding's history, that he was a prolific writer. Mr. E. D. Howe, who 
        published at Painesville, O., in 1834 his Mormonism Unveiled, states (p. 
        287) that he learned from the widow of Spaulding that her husband 
        <I>"had a great variety of manuscripts</I> and that one was entitled the 
        'Manuscript Found.'" She supposed that "it was then (1834) <I>with his 
        other manuscripts</I> in a trunk which she had left in Otsego County, N. 
        Y." <BR><BR>Mr. Spaulding's daughter, Mrs. McKinstry, now of Washington, 
        D. C., in her statement in Scribner's Monthly for August, 1880, says 
        that her father "frequently wrote little stories which he read to me," 
        She also mentions the trunk in which her "mother had placed <I>all my 
        father's writings</I> which had been preserved. There were sermons and 
        other papers; and I saw a manuscript about an inch thick, closely 
        written, tied with some stories my father had written for me, one of 
        which was called 'The Frogs of Wyndham.' On the outside of this 
        manuscript were written the words 'Manuscript Found.' I did not read it, 
        but looked through it, and had it in my hands many times, and <I>saw the 
        names I had heard at Conneaut,</I> when my father read it to his 
        friends. I was about eleven years of age at this time." <BR><BR>John 
        Hyde, in his Mormonism, published in 1857, states (<A 
        href="http://thedigitalvoice.com/enigma/hyd1857d.htm#pg278a">pp. 
        278-9</A>): "Mrs Spaulding, widow, says that she believes the Manuscript 
        was put into a trunk <I>with some others,</I> and that she had it at 
        Hartwick from 1820 to 1832.... After the publication and recognition of 
        the Book of Mormon, this trunk was examined, and only <I>one</I> 
        manuscript was found. The other papers that had been in the trunk were 
        gone. This manuscript that was then found was the commencement of a 
        novel on the subject of the Indians, purporting to bring their 
        forefathers from a colony of Latins. Spaulding, after writing a few 
        pages, had abandoned this idea as being "too recent." <BR><BR>Thus we 
        have evidence of three different Spaulding romances, the theme of each 
        being the colonization of this continent by Europeans; the one given to 
        Mr. Howe by D. P. Hurlbut; the one left by Hurlbut in the trunk in 
        Otsego County, N. Y.; and the one in Honolulu certified by Hurlbut. Not 
        one of these corresponds with the descriptions given by fifteen hearers 
        of the Manuscript Found. We have also the testimony that there were 
        still other writings of Spaulding in the trunk. Why, then, should we be 
        shut up to Mr. Bishop's conclusuion that there could not have been any 
        such story of the colonization of Americas by Jews as fifteen reputable 
        witnesses declare they heard Spaulding read? So long as there is even a 
        possibility that such may have been the case, Mr. Bishop's induction is 
        <I>not proved;</I> and an impartial study of the testimony will convince 
        any candid reader that there certaibly was such a Spaulding romance 
        which has not yet been recovered. One copy passed into Rigdon's 
        possession and one into Hurlbut's. The discovery at Honolulu strengthens 
        this last hypothesis, for it proves conclusively that Hurlbut's stout 
        denial that he ever had any Spaulding manuscript except the one he gave 
        to Mr. Howe, was utterly false. Hurlbut's unwilling admission to Mrs. E. 
        E. Dickinson (New Light, p. 67) that he "saw the names Mormon, Maroni, 
        Lamanite, Nephi," in the manuscript in his possession, amounts to a 
        confession of his guilt in making away with the document he had so 
        treacherously obtained, and which would have exploded the whole vile 
        fraud at its very inception as with a blast of dynamite. It is rumored 
        that the Mormons are desirous to publish the Honolulu manuscript in 
        order to disprove the Spaulding origin of their revered myth. It would 
        simply prove that this recently discovered story was not the one which 
        Spaulding himself was so anxious to have printed, but it would prove 
        nothing more. <BR><BR><BR><FONT color=maroon size=3>Note 1: The Rev. 
        Robert Patterson, Jr. wrote several (some not yet located) newspaper 
        articles on the topic of the Spalding authorship claims, both for his 
        own <I>Presbyterian Banner</I> and for other contemporary publications 
        in the Pittsburgh area. His various contributions of this sort have yet 
        to all be collected and compiled into a single sequel to his 1882 <I>Who 
        Wrote the Book of Mormon?</I> The reproduction of some of Patterson's 
        known articles, here on this web-page, will probably be the only such 
        "sequel" compilation attempted for his post-1882 writings on this 
        subject. <BR><BR>Note 2: Patterson is, of course, wrong in insisting 
        upon there having been three different unaccounted-for Spalding 
        mansucripts, other than the infamous "Manuscript Found." In fact, no 
        manuscript whatever is known to have been "left by Hurlbut in the trunk 
        in Otsego County." From all acounts, Hurlbut left that trunk empty when 
        he departed that place late in 1833. One Spalding manuscript certainly 
        recovered from that trunk was indeed "given to Mr. Howe by D. P. 
        Hurlbut;" and it was that same Spalding document which eventually became 
        "the one in Honolulu certified by Hurlbut." On the other hand, Patterson 
        was quite correct in stating in this article that the manuscript 
        described by Rev. Sereno E. Bishop was not the same one described by 
        "fifteen reputable witnesses" who had known Solomon Spalding. Much the 
        same sort of argument against Bishop's conclusions was provided by the 
        Rev. William H. Whitsitt and saw publication in <I>The Independent</I> 
        of <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NY/nyin1880.htm#100185">Oct. 
        1, 1885</A>. <BR><BR>Note 3: Other than in this 1885 article, Robert 
        Patterson, Jr. seems to have avoided discussing the Spalding manuscript 
        discovered in Hawaii the year before. The <I>Presbyterian Banner,</I> 
        for example, makes no mention of James H. Fairchild's pronouncements 
        regarding that document. Perhaps Patterson missed seeing the Fairchild 
        news articles in the papers, and by the time he became aware of the 
        manuscript discovered in Hawaii, the news was too stale to mention in 
        the pages of the <I>Banner.</I>

      <P align=center><SMALL><B>REV. &nbsp;FORSCUTT &nbsp;ON &nbsp;THE 
      &nbsp;SPAULDING &nbsp;MANUSCRIPT.</B></SMALL> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>A communication has been received from Mark H. Forscutt, 
        pastor of Saints' Church, Fourth avenue, with reference to the 
        posthumous story of the late Rev. Solomon Spaulding, upon which the Book 
        of Mormon is by many believed to have been founded. In speaking of the 
        "Manuscript Found," by which the original manuscript of Spaulding's 
        story is known, Mr. Forscutt says: 'The publication of the Manuscript 
        Found uncovers the fraud. Friends of the deceased Spaulding have 
        certified that the historic 'incidents,' in detail, name and all 
        contained therein, (except 'the religious part,' as found in the Book of 
        Mormon,) are identical with those written by Mr. Spaulding in his 
        'Manuscript Found.' They tell us also that 'the sorrow-stricken widow,' 
        and brother, and friends of 'the revered and lamented' Mr. Spaulding 
        were 'much shocked,' and that the 'widowed wife wept bitterly,' when she 
        and they heard the Book of Mormon read, and saw that his work had been 
        prostituted to 'so base a use;' for they recognized the names of Laban, 
        Lehi, Nephi and others there found as 'names which they remembered very 
        distinctly(!)' precisely as they occured in the Manuscript Found! Now 
        that this precious manuscript is published, the phenomenally excellent 
        memories of Mr. Spaulding's friends, who could accurately remember and 
        succinctly describe, more than twenty years aferwards, what they had 
        casually heard read by the fireside to while away the long winter 
        evenings -- these remarkable memories can now be tested. The only 
        drawback to their memorial powers lies in the two facts: Firstly, That 
        they remembered only after hearing the Book of Mormon read, and after 
        having been admonished of the identity; and secondly, and most damaging 
        of all, that they remembered what had no existence in fact and perjured 
        themselves to destroy, if possible, the calims of that book, for not one 
        of these names that they remembered, so distinctly is in the Manuscript 
        Found, and yet it is the veritable manuscript they certified to. It was 
        possessed by Mr. Howe, and would have been published by him only 'it did 
        not read as they expected it would;' for it was obtained for this 
        purpose from Mrs. Spaulding by D. P. Hurlbut, and handed by him to Howe 
        for publication. It was transferred by Howe in 1839-40 to Mr. L. L. 
        Rice, who has owned it ever since. Will these testators and their 
        publishers now -- will the men be manly enough, the women womanly 
        enough, the publishers hinest enough to make the amende honorable? We 
        shall see." <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note 1: The Editor of 
        the Pittsburgh <I>Leader</I> neglects to inform his readers that Elder 
        Mark H. Forscutt (1834-1903) was pastor of the <U>Reorganized Latter 
        Day</U> "Saints' Church" in Pittsburgh at this date. Forscutt had been 
        an RLDS since 1865 and he should have made this fact clear when he wrote 
        his letter to the <I>Leader.</I> His obvious purpose was to promote the 
        new "party line" of the RLDS leaders: that they had recently located <A 
        href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/rlds1885.htm">and 
        published</A> Solomon Spalding's long lost "Manuscript Found" and shown 
        it to be in no way connected with the Book of Mormon, thus supposedly 
        disproving most of the old evidence supporting the Spalding authorship 
        claims. <BR><BR>Note 2: Elder Forscutt alleges that what little the 
        Conneaut witnesses knew of Solomon Spalding's writings, "they had 
        casually heard read by the fireside to while away the long winter 
        evenings." This is a gross misrepresentation of their testimony relating 
        why and how Spalding communicated the contents of his "Manuscript Found" 
        to neighbors living near the banks of Conneaut Creek. Spalding's 
        writings reportedly gave the long-sought origin of the mysterious 
        ancient mounds and strange artifacts of an "advanced" culture so evident 
        throughout the Conneaut region. The origin of these remarkable 
        antiquities he attributed to an ancient Old World civilization, a colony 
        of which had been miraculously transported to the Americas long before 
        Columbus. For this reason, if for no other, Spalding's readers and 
        auditors were prone to consider his purported "ancient" epic story with 
        great curiosity and interest. After all, he represented his unique 
        American epic as having been a wonderous "ancient record" dug up in 
        their very own, mound-strewn backyards. <BR><BR>Besides this, Spalding 
        parceled out his disclosures from this "ancient record" in small 
        installments, creating the 1812 equivalent of a media serial -- 
        something like a frontier version of the still well-remembered "Roots" 
        TV mini-series. Quite likely Spalding accentuated his readings from the 
        "ancient record" with the dramatic flair of an accomplished oral 
        story-teller, repeating certain portions for emphasis and re-summarizing 
        the story to date at the beginning of each periodic installment reading. 
        Some of his neighbors thus encountered the telling of America's ancient 
        epic in a suspenseful, content repetitive, and uniquely memorable group 
        experience. In an era when there was precious little literary diversion 
        available in the Conneaut region, Spalding's serialized readings of 
        secret works of darkness, bloody contentions, and heroic stratagems may 
        well have been hos neighbors' only entertaining group experience during 
        the dark days of the War of 1812. <BR><BR>In the case of Henry Lake, 
        Solomon Spalding reportedly tried very hard to ensnare Lake as a partner 
        in financing the publication of this "ancient record." Spalding no doubt 
        attempted the same sales promotion with other neighbors in the Conneaut 
        area, foisting upon them endless readings from the verisimilitude of his 
        hand-written epic. As a side issue, Spalding thus publicized his pet 
        notion: that the ancient American were actually Israelites and the 
        Indians were their degenerated descendants. This story element accounted 
        neatly for both the origin of America's mysterious antiquities and 
        explaned where a "remnant" of ancient Israel had been preserved 
        (necessary to fulfill certain important millennialistic prophecies).

        a Baptist preacher in this city, became one of the Mormon leaders, and 
        every now and then Mormon missionaries have been sent to this region. A 
        telegram to the Dispatch of this city from McKeesport says: <SMALL>"For 
        some time past a company of men wearing slouch hats and pantaloons

        in manners or speech. Illiterate and uncouth as they were, still silly 
        women and effeminate men would crowd around them. For some time past 
        they have been holding 'Mormon church' in school houses near Monongahela 
        City. Whenever the announcement was made that the Mormon preachers would 
        hold forth the school houses were crowded with many who came out of 
        curiosity to hear of the doctrine and learn somewhat of the life led in 
        far-off Utah. The missionaries pictured the happy homes and the full 
        coffers of the faithful, and so interested some of their hearers that in 
        several households trouble has arisen."</SMALL> It is charged that

        Bickerton left the Utah Mormons after their 1852 public admission of the 
        doctrine of polygamy and then set up dissenting LDS branches in western 
        Pennsylvania and what is today West Virginia. "Monongahela City" remains 
        the headquarters of the Bickertonite Mormons, which today number about 
        10,000 members. On the other hand, the preaching missionaries mentioned 
        in the report may have been Utah elders who were looking for converts 
        among the Pennsylvania Bickertonites.

      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Redick McKee, Esq.</B>, well known to many of the older 
        readers of the B<SMALL>ANNER</SMALL>, died at Berkeley Springs, West 
        Virginia, on Monday evening, Sept. 13th, in the 86th year of his age. 
        His death was sudden and unexpected. A private letter from him, of Sept. 
        9th, was received at the B<SMALL>ANNER</SMALL> office Sept. 11th, 
        relating to work which he had then in contemplation. Mr. McKee was born 
        Dec. 7, 1800, at McKeesport, Alleghany County, Pa., of which town his 
        father was the proprietor and founder. In early life he was in such 
        delicate health that he was not expected to reach maturity, and for the 
        same reason his school education was limited to about four months. His 
        mother, however, well fulfilled at home the office of a teacher. A few 
        years of life on the farm of an uncle so far invigorated his health that 
        in his 12th year he entered the employment of Messrs. Hugh and James 
        Jelley, who conducted an extensive mercantile business in Pittsburgh. So 
        rapidly did he develop a faculty for business that two years afterwards 
        and whilst in his 14th year, he was entrusted by his employeers with the 
        management of a branch store which they established at Amity, Washington 
        Co., Pa., with a stock of assorted goods amounting to $5,000 or $6,000. 
        Here he remained nearly two years, during the whole of which time he 
        boarded with Rev. Solomon Spaulding, whose name has been so often 
        mentioned in connection with the authorship of "The Book of Mormon." 
        <BR><BR>Mr. McKee was probably the last survivor of those who heard Mr. 
        Spaulding read his famous "Manuscript Found," and who distinctly 
        remembered Mr. Spaulding having suspected Sidney Rigdon of making a copy 
        of his romance whilst it was in the printing office in Pittsburgh. After 
        leaving Amity Mr. McKee became a prominent business man in Pittsburgh, 
        Wheeling, and for a time in California; was a serious laborer in Sabbath 
        Schools; was early chosen to the office of Ruling Elder, and was for 
        some time before his death the only surviving member of the first Board 
        of Directors of the Western Theological Seminary after Allegheny had 
        been selected as its site, in 1827. He was also one of the speakers at 
        the centennial celebration of the Upper and Lower Ten Mile churches in 
        Washington County, August 29, 1879. He retained to the last the use of 
        his mental powers and his interest in the affairs of Church and State.

      <P align=center><B><BIG>About the Mormons.</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Rev. T. Lamb, of the Baptist Church, has spent a year in the 
        study of the Mormon problem and in work upon the Mormons in Utah. In a 
        lecture given in Philadelphia a few evenings ago he mentioned some 
        things respecting the beliefs and character of these strange people not 
        generally known. Mormons believe that the heads of the Church upon earth 
        will become gods after death and that they will create a new world for 
        their followers. They believe that each world has a God and that there 
        is one Supreme God governing all. Adam is supposed to be the God 
        controlling this world. At present the divine Adam makes his revelations 
        to John Taylor, president of the Mormon Church, and Taylor, through his 
        disciples and other subordinates, diffuses the knowledge among the 
        people. The system is so perfect that in a day all the Mormons in Utah 
        may become aware of a new revelation. <BR><BR>Mr. Lamb says a true 
        Mormon cannot be loyal to any government until the government is placed 
        below the Church. The first obstacle a missionary meets is the 
        inordinate conceit of a Mormon. They ridicule the idea of anyone 
        teaching them. A second difficulty is their hatred of all Gentiles and 
        especially of all preachers, whom they hold responsible for their 
        troubles with the government. They reject all professions of love. One 
        [Baptist] missionary had for years to go eight or ten miles to supply 
        necessities of life to his family as no Mormon in the town where he 
        lived would sell him anything. <BR><BR>Notwithstanding all that the 
        Edmunds law has done, and it has been at least a partial success, the 
        Mormon priests are urging their people to resist all attempts to prevent 
        or break up polygamous marriages. <BR><FONT color=maroon 
        size=3><BR><BR>Note: Rev. Lamb authored the <A 
        href="http://www.helpingmormons.org/golden_bible.htm">1886 book</A> 
        <I>The Golden Bible.</I> Lamb's information on the LDS teaching of 
        "Father Adam" being "Jehovah" is a bit outdated; under President John 
        Taylor's administration, the LDS Church abandoned once and for all the 
        old doctrine of Adam as God. Taylor's <A 
        href="http://www.kingdomofzion.org/doctrines/library/lds/Med&amp;Atone.txt">1882 
        book</A> <I>The Mediation and the Atonement</I> helped restore a more 
        traditional Christian theology among the Utah Saints. Although Lamb 
        claims that Taylor's revelations were very quickly disseminated among 
        the Mormons, oddly enough they never elected to publish any of them in 
        their <I>Doctrine and Covenants.</I>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>It is well known that there is a number of Mormons who claim 
        to be followers of Joseph Smith, as his system was originally 
        instituted, who reject the teachings of Brigham Young with regard to 
        plural marriages and many other things. Joseph Smith, Jr., a son of the 
        founder of the original Mormon sect, is the presidig officer of this 
        section of Mormonism, which claims to be the reorganized Church of the 
        Latter Day Saints, or the old or original Mormons. They are known as 
        "Josephites," because they claim to be followers of Joseph Smith. 
        <BR><BR>Some of these people live in this city and neighborhood, and 
        hold occasional services. But they are widely dispersed and quite active 
        in the propagation of their tenets. Nine years ago there were 17,928 
        members of the reorganized Church. To-day there are 19, 235 registered 
        members. In the last year 1710 members were baptized, 157 were lost by 
        expulsion and 317 by death, leaving a net gain of 1306 members. Iowa has 
        the largest number of saints, 4237, and Missouri comes next with 2085, 
        Virginia is at the foot of the column with only six members, while Utah, 
        the hot-bed of Morminism, has only 496 Josephites. Besides the 
        membership in the United States, Australia, Denmark, England, Scotland, 
        the Society Islands, Switzerland, Wales, Canada, Manitoba, and Nova 
        Scotia all furnish proselytes to this faith. Twenty-one new branches 
        have been started this year and about $30,000 in cash has been received 
        in contributions from members. Between this beanch of Mormonism and the 
        Utah Mormons there is a fierce hostility. <BR><BR>In the town of 
        Kirtland, Ohio, thirty miles from Cleveland, is the old temple erected 
        by Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon -- the copyist of Spaulding's romance 
        which was essentially adopted as the Mormon bible -- in 1834. Ten years 
        afterwards the Mormons divided, and the building fell into the hands of 
        those now known as the Utah Mormons. For years its possession has been 
        contested in the courts, but it has been at length given to the 
        Josephites, or the reorganized Church of the Latter Day Saints, who 
        ashere to the rule of single marriage. Last Wednesday a conference of 
        eight days was begun in that place. About 100 delegates, representing 
        every "Josephite" Society in this country, were present. A good deal of 
        time was taken up in what might be termed devotional services. These 
        people are full believers in the power of working miracles at the 
        present time. Many remarkable instances of what they term "faith cures" 
        were related. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Notes: (forthcoming)

      <P align=center><B><BIG>A &nbsp;MORMON &nbsp;REVIVAL.</BIG></B> </P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The conference of anti-polygamist Mormons, recently held at 
        Kirtland, Ohio, to which we have heretofore referred, has given evidence 
        of the energy and persistence with which this branch of a deluded sect 
        is exerting itself to win converts, and also of the fact that in some 
        degree it is succeeding in its efforts. The circumstance that these 
        followers of Joseph Smith denounce the polygamous abomination of the 
        Utah Mormons is kept before the public, and is calculated to win for 
        them the reputation of being adherents to a comparatively harmless 
        fanaticism. The public mind should be disabused of this error. Conceding 
        all that has been claimed for them as contrasted with those who adopt 
        and practice the hideous teachings of Brigham Young and his successors, 
        they nevertheless regard as divine the blasphemous pretended revelations 
        of Joseph Smith. Not only so, but if the published reports of the recent 
        proceedings at Kirtland can be relied upon, they still claim that God is 
        making known to them his will by direct special communication. 
        <BR><BR>At the conference there, as reported, the President, Joseph 
        Smith, a son of the founder of Mormonism, announced, April 12th, that he 
        had "communed with the Spirit," and then delivered an alleged 
        revelation. It is impossible to resist the conviction that any man who 
        now makes such a claim must be, if sane, a conscious impostor. The 
        Conference itself seemed to think that caution was necessary, as the 
        reporter proceeded to explain "how such a matter is treated by the 
        Church. In the first place, the revelation is presented to the First 
        Presidency, who consider it in detail, and express their views of it. 
        Then it passes to a quorum of Apostles, who also deliberate and state 
        any objections they may have to it. From them it goes to the Elders' 
        Quorum, and from them to the body of the Church. It is a matter that is 
        freely discussed, and the whole revelation may be discarded (!) if the 
        members of the Church see fit." Think of discarding a divine revelation! 
        <BR><BR>The anti-polygamous Mormons, equally with their sensual 
        co-religionists in Utah, receive as divinely inspired all the 
        monstrosities of "The Book of Mormon." Those persona who have never 
        examined this gigantic imposition can have no conception of the amount 
        of credulity it must require to accept this botched edition of the 
        S<SMALL>PAULDING</SMALL> romance as a revelation from God. As well 
        assert that the wild imaginings of Jules Verne or Baron Munchausen were 
        inspired productions. <BR><BR>To all who wish to inform themselves of 
        the barefaced assumptions, the glaring contradictions, and the amazing 
        puerilities of "The Book of Mormon," we cordially and earnestly commend 
        a recent exposure of this mass of silliness. The work to which we refer 
        is entitled, "The Golden Bible, or The Book of Mormon, Is it From God?" 
        Its author is Rev. M. T. Lamb, assistant pastor of the First Baptist 
        church, Salt Lake City, whose lectures upon the subject in that city 
        drew crowded houses, his audiences being composed mainly of Mormons. The 
        publishers are Messrs. Ward &amp; Drummond, 116 Nassau Street, New York. 
        It is a book which should be widely circulated wherever the apostles of 
        this fraud are working among the people. It would be well if every 
        intelligent Mormon could be supplied with a copy, and benevolent persons 
        who may feel prompted to aid in extending its circulation and usefulness 
        should correspond with the publishers who, we have reason to believe, 
        will supply copies for such an object at the lowest possible price. 
        <BR><BR>A perusal of this work cannot fail to be intensely interesting 
        to those who reflect that this accumulated nonsense is accepted by two 
        hundred thousand persons in this country as the gift of God to his 
        people in these latter days, and as superior in some respects to the 
        Bible itself. The more this singular conglomeration of wild fancy and 
        bungling imposture is examined, the more the wonder grows that any 
        person of ordinary intelligence and common sense could be induced to 
        accept such stuff as divinely inspired. The crowning excellence of Mr. 
        Lamb's exposure of this colossal fraud is the kindly spirit he exhibits. 
        He treats the Mormon sore with the severest caustic, but he applies it 
        with the tenderest touch. The deluded Mormon may wince, but he cannot 
        complain when the impossibilities and contradictions of his sacred book 
        are unsparingly but courteously laid bare. <BR><BR>Among the absurdities 
        of the Mormon fable are the following: 1. That the plates discovered by 
        Joseph Smith contained writings in the Reformed Egyptian language, when 
        there never was such a language. 2. That, as Smith had no acquaintance 
        with this language, he first used in his translating a pair of 
        spectacles which he designated "Urim and Thummim," and afterwards a 
        peculiar stone found in digging a well called a "seer stone," each of 
        which optical instruments had the marvelous power, when used by Smith, 
        of presenting to his eye the exact English word or sentence 
        corresponding to the one or more Egyptian characters. This word or 
        sentence remained visible until his amanuensis had written it precisely 
        as it appeared, and then the next word or sentence would follow. The 
        plates were not always present when this rendition into English was 
        going on; they might as well have remained in the spot whence they were 
        exhumed. This shocking claim would make the Holy Spirit verbally 
        responsible for all the crudities, bad grammar, and bad spelling of the 
        Book of Mormon. 3. Long passages in the "Book of Mormon" are transcribed 
        <I>verbatim</I> from the English Bible; yet the Mormons claim and 
        believe that these passages were contained in the plates discovered by 
        Smith, and are a literal English rendering of the Reformed Egyptian 
        text. How incredible that King James's translators, two hundred and 
        twenty years before the Book of Mormon was published, would hit upon the 
        same English words in translating Hebrew and Greek texts which 
        afterwards appeared in Smith's peep stone as the true rendering of 
        portions of his Reformed Egyptian tablets! 4. Numerous anachronisms 
        occur; as an instance, Nephi, who lived six hundred years before Christ, 
        quotes from Rev. xii:11, which is written about one hundred years after 
        Christ. Similar blunders are frequent. 5. A kindred evidence of fraud is 
        the constant occurrences of words, ideas, references, which are 
        peculiarly modern and betray their recent origin. "From whence no 
        traveler can return" sounds more like Shakespeare than Reformed 
        Egyptian. 6. God's command to the brother of Jared, starting on a 
        voyage, to make a hole in the bottom of each barge, is too startling for 
        belief. <BR><BR>But time and space would fail to enumerate a hundredth 
        part of the absurdities of the Book of Mormon. Mr. Lamb's catalogue of 
        these curiosities is but a selection of specimens. Yet in this era of 
        widely diffused intelligence, the believers in all this nonsense and in 
        this impious claim of Divine authority for it, are awakening to new 
        activity in the propagation of this shameless imposture. If we are to 
        have a revival of Mormonism, it would be wise to scatter broadcast such 
        a book as we have named above. Follow -- or precede -- the bane with the 
        antidote. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Notes: (forthcoming)

      <BR>_______ <BR><BR>Prof. Robert Patterson Dies at His Home in Sewickley. 
      </B></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Prof. Robert Patterson who was stricken with paralysis on 
        last Monday afternoon, died at his home in Sewickley at 4:30 o'clock 
        yesterday morning. The deceased was among the thoroughly educated men of 
        the country, and as a writer was particularly brilliant. He was born in 
        Pittsburgh on October 17, 1821, and received his education at Canonsburg 
        Academy and Jefferson College, graduating in 1841. He studied law, but 
        never practiced the profession, but devoted himself to mathematics. He 
        held chairs in that branch in Jefferson College, In Oakland College, 
        Mississippi, and Center College, Danville, Ky. <BR><BR>In 1864 he became 
        one of the editors of the <I>Presbyterian Banner</I> in this city, which 
        position he held until the time of his death. He was always a most 
        bitter opponent of Mormonism and all its doctrines. Some five years ago 
        he wrote <A href="http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs/1882PatA.htm">a 
        sketch</A>, "The Book of Mormon," which appears in a history of 
        Washington county, in which he treated particularly of the 
        ridiculousness of the inspiration of the Mormon creed, and showing that 
        the book was written by Solomon Spalding. The paper has since become an 
        authority on the Mormon question. He wrote also the "History of the Log 
        College," which was said to have been the first classical school west of 
        the Allegheny Mountains. He took the ground that the first classical 
        school was his alma mater, Jefferson College, and so successfully did he 
        bear out his statements that all further arguments were squelched. 
        <BR><BR>At the time of his death he was engaged in writing a history of 
        the class of '40, Jefferson College, of which he was a member. He leaves 
        besides his widow a son Thomas, a member of the Allegheny County Bar, 
        and two daughters. <BR><BR>The funeral will take place from the chapel 
        of the First Presbyterian Church, on Wood street, on Monday afternoon, 
        at 1:30 o'clock. The Rev. Dr. Campbell will conduct the services.

        <I>History of Pittsburgh and Environs, III</I> provides the following 
        biographical sketch on pages 829-831: <SMALL>"<B>Joseph Patterson</B>, 
        son of Robert Patterson, was born March 20, 1752, and about 1773 came to 
        the American colonies, settling in Saratoga county, N. Y. Later he 
        removed to Germantown, Pa., where he became a teacher in the schools. He 
        was present at the first reading of the Declaration of Independence, at 
        the door of the State House, and there- upon dismissed his school and 
        enlisted as a private in the Continental army, serving in 1776-77. 
        Afterward he migrated to York county, where he continued his work as a 
        teacher, and also engaged in fanning. In 1785, under the guidance of 
        Rev. Joseph Smith, he began to study for the ministry, and on Aug. 12, 
        1788 was licensed to preach. On Nov. 10, 1789 he was ordained and 
        installed pastor of the Raccoon and Montour Run churches, in Allegheny 
        county. In 1816 ill health forced him to resign and he removed to 
        Pittsburgh, where he continued to preach, also distributing Bibles and 
        tracts. When General Lafayette, after an absence of forty years, visited 
        the United States, he recognized Mr. Patterson, who was five years older 
        than himself, as a companion in arms during the War for Independence. 
        Mr. Patterson married (first) in Ireland, Jane Moak, a native of that 
        country, and (second) Rebecca Leach, who was born in Pittsburgh. On Feb. 
        4, 1832, he closed his long, useful and eventful life, having served his 
        adopted country as educator, soldier and minister of the gospel. --- 
        <B>Robert Patterson</B>, son of Joseph and Jane (Moak) Patterson, was 
        born April 1, 1773, in Saratoga county, N. Y., and in 1790 entered 
        Canonsburg Academy, reciting his first lessons under the shade of large 
        trees, the buildings being not yet ready for occupancy. In 1794 he 
        entered the junior class of the University of Pennsylvania, where his 
        Uncle Robert was professor of mathematics, and in 1796 he began the 
        study of theology. In 1801, after touring about four years, he was 
        licensed to preach, and during the next six years ministered to two 
        churches in the vicinity of Erie, Pa. In 1807 he moved to Pittsburgh and 
        took charge of the Pittsburgh Academy, an institution which later 
        developed into the Western University of Pennsylvania, now the 
        University of Pittsburgh. From 1810 to 1836 he was in business as a 
        book-seller, publisher and manufacturer of paper. From 1807 to 1833 he 
        supplied the pulpit of the Pennsylvania church at Highland, seven miles 
        north of Pittsburgh. It is worthy of note that the "Manuscript Found," 
        supposed to have furnished the basis of the Book of Mormon, was left at 
        Mr. Patterson's printing house. Mr. Patterson married Jane, daughter of 
        Colonel John Canon, founder of Canonsburg, the place named in his honor. 
        In 1840 Mr. Patterson retired to the country, where he passed the 
        remainder of his life. His death occurred Sept. 5, 1854, and two years 
        later his widow passed away. --- <B>Robert Patterson</B>, son of Robert 
        and Jane (Canon) Patterson, was born Aug. 17, 1821, in Pittsburgh, and 
        studied law under the preceptorship of Hon. Thomas H. Baird. At the end 
        of three years he was admitted, in October, 1843, to the Allegheny 
        county bar, and for three years more practiced his profession as the 
        associate of Judge Baird. In 1840 he had graduated from Jefferson 
        College, where he later filled the chair of mathematics. He was also 
        professor in several colleges, including Oakland College, Mississippi, 
        and Centre College, Kentucky. In 1863 he became joint owner and editor 
        of the "Presbyterian Banner." At one period in his life Mr. Patterson 
        performed military service in Kentucky, but during the Civil War his 
        application for enlistment was rejected because of physical disability. 
        In politics he was a Republican, and in religious belief a Presbyterian. 
        Mr. Patterson died Nov. 30, 1889. He was a man of more than ordinary 
        ability and of unblemished purity of character. He married, Aug. 27, 
        1851, Eliza, daughter of Judge Thomas H. and Nancy (McCullough) Baird, 
        and the following children were born to them: Thomas... Jane, and 
        Elizabeth."

      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>The Rev. W. A. Stanton</B>, in the course of three 
        sermons to be delivered from his pulpit at the Shady Avenue Baptist 
        church, will attempt to prove that Pittsburg is the home of Mormonism. 
        He claims that Joseph Smith, who, tradition has it, was shown through 
        Divine revelation the gold-rimmed palm leaves [sic!] whereon was written 
        the basis of the Mormon doctrine and faith, stole a manuscript 
        formulated by Sidney Rigdon from a Pittsburg printing office, which is 
        the actual foundation of Mormonism. The Rev. Dr. Stanton has been making 
        a special study of this question for more than four years, and claims to 
        have ample proof of his assertions. He lately returned from the Pacific 
        Coast and Salt Lake City, where he had been looking up data on the 
        aubject. <BR><FONT color=maroon size=3><BR><BR>Note: The exact date of

      <BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL><B>Rev. W. A. Stanton, D. D., Believes Rigdon Used 
        Solomon Spaulding's Religious Romance to Furnish Material for Joseph 
        Smith's Golden Tablets...</B> <BR></SMALL><BR>Rev. W. A. Stanton, D. D., 
        pastor of the Shady Avenue Baptist church, East End, yesterday followed 
        his lecture of last Sunday on the early religious history of Campbell, 
        Scott and Rigdon in Pittsburg by a second lecture devoted to the work of 
        Sidney Rigdon as the "angel" who supplied to Joseph Smith, founder of 
        Mormonism, the material which makes up the Book of Mormon. Dr. Stanton, 
        by much evidence shows that Rigdon in some way secured possession of the 
        manuscript of a religious romance wtitten by Solomon Spaulding, who 
        lived in Pittsburg. Dr. Stanton has made a recent study of Mormonism in 
        Utah. He saw the book in the Tabernacle a few weeks ago. Dr. Stanton 
        said, in substance: <BR><BR><SMALL>"in the address of last Sunday we 
        found that Sidney Rigdon was deposed from the pastorate of the First 
        Baptist church, Pittsburg, and excluded from the Baptist denomination on 
        October 11, 1823. In 1824 he and his followers effected a union with the 
        independent congregation meeting in the Pittsburg court house under the 
        leadership of Walter Scott. Within a few months after this Rigdon went 
        to the Western Reserve, Ohio. From this time until his public connection 
        with Joseph Smith and Mormonism he propagated the doctrines of Campbell 
        and Scott, preaching and circulating their books and periodicals. In a 
        number of instances he succeeded in forming churches where he was 
        allowed to preach, and by stratagem or force, succeeded in securing to 
        his people the church property. <BR><BR>"In August, 1827, Campbell, 
        Scott and Rigdon met again at the Mahoning Baptist association in New 
        Lisbon, O. Campbell was a member of the association . The association 
        disbanded at Austintown in 1829. Scott's biographer, Mr. Baxter, says: 
        'Those Baptists who had embraced the new views, together with the new 
        converts made, were called Campbellites, and by many Scottites, but 
        after yje dissolution of the association, which was really brought about 
        by the efforts of Scott, they were called 'Disciples.'' <BR><BR>"When 
        Rigdon preached at the association in New Lisbon his home was in 
        Kirtland, O. Just 30 days after that sermon Joseph Smith proclaimed his 
        finding of the 'Golden Bible,' better known as 'The Book of Mormon,' at 
        the little village of Manchester, six miles from Palmyra, N. Y. Rigdon 
        soon went thither, professed immediate conversion to the 'find' and 
        straightway preached the first Mormon sermon. It was delivered at 
        Palmyra, and showed a remarkable knowledge of Mormonism for a new 
        convert. It was said that he seemed to know more about it than Joe Smith 
        himself... <BR><BR>"Smith claimed to have been directed by an angel to 
        the burial place of a stone box in which was a volume six inches thick 
        and composed of thin gold leaves eight by seven inches, fastened by 
        these gold rings. The writing on the leaves was said to be 'reformed 
        Egyptian.' There was also a pair of supernatural spectacles consisting 
        of two opaque crystals, that Smith called 'Urim and Thummim.' They were 
        set in a silver bow, and whenever he put that on he could read the 
        'reformed Egyptian language.' My father-in-law, then 19 years old, lived 
        near there, and is still living. He knew Smith. I have heard him say 
        that Smith was an ignorant, smooth-spoken, slippery fellow, lazy, and 
        that he went about digging for lost treasures and locating water springs 
        with a divining rod. He was just the man for Rigdon's use, although he 
        proved in the long run too much for his master. It will probably never 
        be known why Rigdon had to take second place in Mormonism, but it is 
        certain that Smith proved the better politician, and probably held the 
        whip of secrecy over Rigdon. Neither man had the means to publish this 
        'Golden Bible.' They succeeded in interesting a well-to-do farmer. 
        Martin Harris, who furnished the money. Oliver Cowdery was employed as 
        an amanuensis, writing what Smith dictated to him, Smith being on the 
        farther side of a concealing curtain. In 1830 the book was printed, and 
        with it a sworn statement by Cowdery, Harris and a David Whitmer that an 
        'angel of God' had shown them the plates from which the book purported 
        to be a translation. <BR><BR>"In after years these three men renounced 
        Mormonism and said that their sworn statement was false. A few weeks ago 
        I stood in the Tabernacle at Salt Lake City and open the Book of Mormon 
        that lay upon one of the pulpits there. It contained the oath of the 
        three men. When asked asked what became of the the original 'Golden 
        Bible' the Mormons give you to understand that an angel removed it after 
        Smith translated it. <BR><BR>"Now we return to Pittsburg: Solomon 
        Spaulding was born in Ashford, Conn., in 1761, and was graduated from 
        Dartmouth college in 1786. Later he lived in New Salem and Conneaut, O. 
        There he wrote a romance that he called 'The Manuscript Found.' He read 
        it to many of his relatives and friends. In it were such names as 
        Mormon, Maroni, Lamanite and Nephi. It divided the people on this 
        continent long ago, into the righteous and the idolatrous, and told the 
        story of the discovery of their history as recorded in a manuscript that 
        had been for centuries concealed in the earth. It was full of wars and 
        rumors of wars, and presented a record of the preaching of Christianity 
        on this continent during the first century. As a minister Mr. Spaulding 
        had made his story conform closely to the historical closing of the 
        Bible: It fitted in as a sequel. In 1812 he moved to Pittsburg. Robert 
        Patterson had a printing office here; his foreman was Silas Engles. 
        Spaulding wanted Patterson to print his romance, but had not the means 
        to secure the printer in case the book was a failure. Patterson told 
        Engles to publish it if Spaulding furnished the security. Patterson 
        always said he supposed Engles returned the manuscript to the author. In 
        1814 Spaulding moved to Amity, Washington county, Pa., where he died in 
        1816. Joseph Miller, of Amity, knew him well and knew the contents of 
        his manuscript. <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#020679">The 
        Pittsburg 'Telegraph,' in 1879</A>, reports Miller as telling that 
        Spaulding told him that while he was writing a preface for the book the 
        manuscript was spirited away, and that he suspected a young man named 
        Rigdon of taking it. Redick McKee, of Washington county, told the same 
        story. Both men recognize the likeness of the Book of Mormon to the lost 
        manuscript. Some of Rigdon's friends at Library claimed that Rigdon 
        never lived in Pittsburg at that time, and did not work in a printing 
        office. On the other hand, we have the testimony of Mrs. R. J. Eichbaum, 
        who died in Pittsburg in 1882. Her father was postmaster and she was 
        clerk in the office from 1811 to 1816. She said that Sidney Rigdon and 
        the young Lambdin, who became Patterson's partner in 1818, were very 
        intimate and often came together for their mail. Also that Engles said 
        that Rigdon was 'always hanging about the office,' Spaulding's widow 
        testified that Rigdon was connected with the printing office in some 
        way. <BR><BR>"Rev. John Winter, M. D., well known to many here to-day, 
        testified that he was in Rigdon's study when he was pastor at the First 
        church. In 1822-3, and that Rigdon took from his desk a large manuscript 
        and said, in substance: 'A Presbyterian minister, Mr. Spaulding, whose 
        health failed, brought this to the printer to see if it would pay to 
        publish it. It is a romance of the Bible,' Rev. A. J. Bonsall, now 
        pastor of the Baptist church at Rochester, Pa., has told me that Dr. 
        Winter, his step-father, often referred to this incident, saying that 
        Rigdon said he got it from the printers. Dr. Winter's daughter, Mrs. 
        Mary W. Irvine, of Sharon, Pa., says" 'I have frequently heard my father 
        speak of Rigdon's having Spaulding's manuscript; that he said he got it 
        from the printer to read it as a curiosity. As such he showed it to my 
        father, but at that time seemed to have no thought of making the use of 
        it that he later did. Father always said that Rigdon helped Smith in his 
        plan by revising and transforming this manuscript into the 'Mormon 
        Bible.' <BR><BR>"In 1879 Mrs. Amos Dunlop, of Warren, O., wrote of 
        having visited the Rigdons when she was young and of his taking a 
        manuscript from his trunk and becoming greatly interested in it. His 
        wife threatened to burn it, but he said, 'No. indeed, you will not: this 
        will be a great thing some day.' In 1820 the Widow Spaulding married a 
        Mr. Davidson, of Hartwick, Otsego county, N. Y.: in May, 1839, the 
        Boston 'Recorder' published a statement from her, made to and recorded 
        by Rev. Dr. R. Austin, of Monson, Mass, to the effect that a Mormon 
        preacher took a copy of the Mormon Bible to New Salem, O., where her 
        husband had lived; and where much of his romance had been written, and 
        read from that Bible in a public meeting. Many of the older people who 
        had known her husband immediately recognized it as her husband's story, 
        and his brother, John Spaulding, rose in the meeting and publicly 
        protested against such a use of his brother's writings. Rigdon wrote a 
        coarse and emphatic denial of this to the 'Recorder,' and said he had 
        never heard of such a man as Spaulding. In August, 1880, 'Scribner's 
        Monthly' published some 'testimony from Spaulding's daughter, Mrs. M. S. 
        McKinstry, of Washington, D. C. She testified to the same facts that her 
        mother had given. Mrs. President Garfield's father, Mr. Z. Rudolph, knew 
        Rigdon well, and has certified that during the winter previous to the 
        appearance of the Mormon Bible, Rigdon spent weeks away from home, gone 
        no one knew where. His joining the Mormons so quickly made his neighbors 
        sure that he was in the secret of the authorship of the 'Book of 
        Mormon.' The 'Book' was printed in the office of the 'Wayne Sentinel,' 
        Palmyra, N. Y. The editor of that paper was Pomeroy Tucker. In 1867 he 
        published 'The Origin and Progress of Mormonism.' In that he says that 
        during the summer of 1827 (Smith's 'finf' being that same autumn) a 
        stranger made several mysterious visits at Smith's house. This stranger 
        was afterward reconized as Rigdon. <BR><BR>"Tucker's statement is 
        corroborated by Mrs. Dr. Horace Eaton, who lived in Palmyra for more 
        than 30 years. Testimony has been secured from many others. As early as 
        1835 E. D. Howe, of Painesville, O., printed the full testimony of eight 
        reliable witnesses, such persons as John Spaulding and his wife, Henry 
        Lake, a former business associate of Solomon Spaulding; Oliver Smith, 
        Aaron Wright and Naham Howard, all of Conneaut, O., and all of whom 
        certified as to the substantial identity of Spaulding's romance and the 
        Book of Mormon. Rigdon's own brother-in-law, Rev. Adam Bently, and 
        Alexander Campbell both tell of a conversation that Rigdon had with them 
        at least two years before the Book of Mormon made its appearance. He 
        told them 'that such a book was coming out, the manuscript of which had 
        been found engraved on gold plates.' In spite of their united testimony 
        Rigdon claimed that he first heard of the Book of Mormon from Parley P. 
        Pratt in August, 1830, three years after it was found by Smith...

        late 19th century was living in Rochester. Stanton mentions in his 
        sermon that he had communicated with Bonsall on the matter of Rev. John 
        Winter having once conversed with Sidney Rigdon in Pittsburgh regarding 
        Spalding's writings. It also appears likely that Rev. Stanton was in 
        contact with his fellow Baptist minister, Rev. William H. Whitsitt, 
        lately the President of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary at 
        Louisville, Kentucky. Whitsitt probably derived some of his information 
        and ideas regarding Sidney Rigdon's early history from communication 
        with Baptist ministers residing in Pittsburgh during the mid-1880s. 
        <BR><BR>Note 4: Rev. William A, Stanton summarized his three sermons an 
        interesting article that he sent to the <I>Chicago Standard</I> and 
        published in that newspaper on <A 
        href="http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IL/miscill3.htm#072299">July 
        22, 1899</A>. In this article, "The Relation of Sidney Rigdon to the 
        Book of Mormon," Rev. Stanton ends by saying: "... in spite of this, 
        Rigdon claimed that he first heard of the Book of Mormon from parley P. 
        Pratt in August, 1830. In light of this evidence, whence think ye came 
        the Book of Mormon, and what is its claim to divine authority? Was not 
        Rigdon Joseph Smith's angel?" The claim that Rigdon, in contacts with 
        Joseph Smith, Jr. and other early Mormons, posed as an angelic "fellow 
        servant" in their latter day work of "restoring the fulness of the 
        gospel," was not Stanton's innovation. Other investigators of Mormon 
        origins came to this same conclusion, but Rev. Stanton gave that 
        conclusion wider publicity; his allegation, that Rigdon was the somewhat 
        less than heavenly "messenger" claimed by Smith to be his source for the 
        record of the Nephites, was repeated in Stanton's <A 
        href="http://sidneyrigdon.com/1907Stan.htm">c. 1907 book</A>, <I>Three 
        Important Movements: Campbellism, Mormonism, and Spiritualism,</I> (see 
        the Aug. 20, 1913 issue of the <I>Saints' Herald</I> for a notice and 
        the Oct 29, 1913 issue for a review). Stanton's <I>Chicago Standard</I> 
        article on Rigdon as the "angel" was reprinted in Edgar E. Folk's 1900 
        book, <I>The Mormon Monster.</I> <BR><BR>Note 5: Clearly Rev. Robert 
        Patterson, Jr., Rev. William H. Whitsitt, and Rev. William A. Stanton 
        shared some specific views concerning the relationship of Campbellism 
        and early Mormonism, along with their jointly-held notion that Rigdon 
        was the lynch-pin between the two religious movements (and that he was 
        the "angel" of Smith's visionary stories). For speculation on how 
        shining angels might have been manufactured, to dupe Rigdon's credulous 
        followers in Kirtland, Ohio, see the <A
