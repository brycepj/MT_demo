<h2 align="center">Spalding and the Alphabet &amp; Grammar</h2>
Joseph Smith's Alphabet and Grammar is a small work, but it nonetheless shares a remarkable number of similarities in vocabulary with the Spalding manuscript. These similarities are all the more remarkable, considering that a number of the terms examined here do not appear in the Book of Mormon.
<h2 align="center">character, compound, mark</h2>
<strong>Spalding MS</strong><br />
They had <strong>ch[ar]acters</strong> which represent words -- &amp; all <strong>compound</strong> words had each part represented by its appropriate <strong>character</strong>. The variation of cases moods &amp; tenses was designated by certain <strong>marks</strong> placed under the <strong>Character</strong>. [ObMs 51]<br />
he had invented the art of expres[s]ing ideas by certain <strong>marks</strong> or <strong>chara[c]ters</strong>. . . . the art of making &amp; applying the <strong>characters</strong> to the words which they represented [ObMs 68]
<p><strong>Alphabet &amp; Grammar</strong><br />
This <strong>character</strong> is from the first degree It has an arbitrary sound . . . and also a <strong>compound</strong> sound . . . . It is only increased or lessened in its signification by its connection with other <strong>characters</strong>. one connection with another <strong>character</strong>, gives it a <strong>compound</strong> signification, or enlarges the sentence. . . . When it is <strong>compounded</strong> with others, it can only have one sound. Every <strong>character</strong> in this alphabet is subject to the above restrictions. [First degree, first part]<br />
This <strong>character</strong>, that is the <strong>character</strong> of the second degree, is designated from <strong>characters</strong> of the first degree by the manner of its being inserted in the <strong>compound</strong> . . . . [Second Degree, first part]<br />
This <strong>character</strong> is in the fifth degree . . . . That is, without a straight <strong>mark</strong> inserted above or below it. By inserting a straight <strong>mark</strong> over it thus . . . . [Fifth degree, first part]<br />

Ash: The <strong>compound</strong> of Zub Zool oan [second degree, first part]<br />

Iota nitahach ah que: It[s] signification may be lessened one half by the <strong>mark</strong> as in the margin And again lessened one half of the latter half the <strong>mark</strong> as in [t]he margin It[s] signification is increase[d] tenfold by the <strong>mark</strong> as in the margin: its signification is again increased one hundred fold by the additional <strong>mark</strong> in the margin [second degree, first part]<br />
Zip Zi: by being inserted above or below another <strong>character</strong> it increases by being drawn above . . . And when inserted under signifies beneath less smaller least [fourth degree, first part]<br /></p>

In reading Spalding's manuscript one gets the impression that Solomon deliberately varied the spelling of names as he went along, just to see how they looked and sounded. He sometimes changed just a vowel, or just a consonant, and at other times changed both a vowel and consonant, e.g., Hamack, Hamback, Hambock; Hamko, Hamkol, Hamkoo. Spalding also created new names around a basic root or unit, e.g., Hakoon, Hamboon, Taboon, Ulipoon, mammoon; Lakoonrod, Moonrod; Hambock, Rambock; Hamack, Labamack, Ramack. Some of Spalding's names also undoubtedly came from the Bible, e.g., Hamul. Geheno probably came from Gehenna, and Hadoram must have inspired Hadokam/Hadocam. Nimrod probably suggested Lakoonrod and Moonrod.
<p>In fact Spalding probably derived his method of generating names by observing similar patterns in biblical names, e.g., Gibeon, Gideon, Gideoni; Hachaliah, Hachilah, Hachmoni; Hagab, Hagaba, Hagabah, Hagar, Haggai, Haggedolim, Haggeri, Haggi, Haggiah, Haggith; Machi, Machir, Machnadebai, Machpelah; Mahalah, Mahalaleel, Mahalath, Mahali, Mahanaim, Maharai, Mahath, Mahazioth; Mahlah, Mahli, Mahlon, Mahol. A number of names in the Bible end in -iah, e.g., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, Obadiah, Zechariah, Zephaniah. </p>
<p>Names in the Book of Mormon show similar patterns, e.g., Ammaron, Ammon, Ammonite, Ammonihah, Ammonhihahite, Ammoron; Corianton, Coriantor, Coriantum, Coriantumr; Corihor, Korihor; Gad, Gadiandi, Gadianton, Gadiomnah; Gid, Giddonah, Giddianhi, Gideon, Gidgiddonah, Gidgiddoni; Moron, Ammoron, Moroni. Names in the Book of Mormon that end in -ihah include: Ammonihah, Cumenihah, Mathonihah, Moronihah, Nephihah, Zemnarihah. </p>
