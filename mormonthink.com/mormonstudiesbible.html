<h2 align="center"><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Not only is the Book of Mormon written in a style that imitates the King James Bible, but it also incorporates actual phrases and sometimes entire blocks of material from the KJV. Many Book of Mormon passages combine phrases from several different biblical texts. The more interesting quotations are those that are taken from the New Testament, long before the biblical documents were even composed. The sheer volume of these quotations also has serious implications for such issues as the manner in which the Book of Mormon was supposedly translated. The following material lists some of the biblical texts found in the Book of Mormon. This list is in no way complete, but it illustrates how biblical text is literally woven into the Book of Mormon.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="matthew" id="matthew"></a>Matthew</h2>

<h2 align="center"><a name="ot" id="ot"></a>The Old Testament</h2>
<p>Of course, the Book of Mormon also incorporates phrases from Old Testament documents. Characters in the Book of Mormon work the Old Testament into their speeches and writings, and this sometimes creates significant problems. We will consider only a few examples here.</p>
<p>In giving instructions to his son Corianton, Alma quotes Genesis:<br />
Gen. 3:22-24: And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.<br />
Alma 42:2-3: God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken -- yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life -- Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit.</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments, as listed in Exodus, are reproduced in Mosiah. Mosiah 12:34-36 corresponds to Exodus 20:2-4. Mosiah 13:12-24 corresponds to Exodus 20:4-17.</p>

<p>Judith, one of the books of the Apocrypha, provides material for the story of the slaying of Laban.<br />
Judith 13:2: And Judith was left alone in the tent, and Holofernes lying alone upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.<br />
Judith 13:4-8: Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present upon the works of mine hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. For now is the time to help mine inheritance, and to execute thine enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which are risen against us Then she came to the pillar of the bed, which was at Holofernes' head, and took down his fauchion from thence, And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day. And she smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and she took away his head from him.<br />
Judith 13:15: So she took the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and said unto them, Behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness; and the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a woman.<br />
1 Nephi 4:7-9: Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken with wine. And when I came to him I found that it was Laban. And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof ....<br />
1 Nephi 4:12-13: And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands; behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.<br />
1 Nephi 4:18: Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.</p>
<p>Tobit, another book of the Apocrypha, contains a further parallel. When Nephi and his brothers were absent many days, trying to get the brass plates from Laban, their mother mourned for them. Similarly, when Tobias, who had been sent to recover ten talents of silver from a kinsman, was absent for fourteen days, his mother thought that he was dead.<br />
Tobit 10:4-7: Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing he stayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said, Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes. To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no care, for he is safe. But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias<br />
1 Nephi 5:1-5: my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us. For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father,&#8230;saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness. And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father. And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying:&#8230;I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah</p>
<p>Nephi's account of his family's journey in the wilderness after leaving Jerusalem has a number of parallels with the story of the Israelites' journey in the wilderness after leaving Egypt.</p>

<p>The Jaredite account also seems to draw upon the Apocrypha. Note that the phrase &quot;where never mankind dwelt&quot; in 2 Esdras parallels &quot;where there never had man been&quot; in Ether.<br />
2 Esdras 13:40-45: Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land. But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt, That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land. And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river. For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over. For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.<br />
Ether 2:5: And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel.</p>
<p>Here are some other Old Testament parallels.</p>
<p>Genesis 10:9: He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.<br />
Ether 10:19: And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in the sight of the Lord.&#8230;And Lib also himself became a great hunter.</p>
<p>Judges 8:34: And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side<br />
Mosiah 2:4: the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies</p>
<p>Judges 21:21: And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.<br />
Mosiah 20:4-5: having discovered the daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them; and when there were but few of them gathered together to dance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them and carried them into the wilderness</p>
<p>1 Kings 14:11: Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat<br />
Mosiah 12:2: and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall devour their flesh.</p>
<p>Daniel 3:20-23, 25: And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.&#8230;He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.<br />

<p>Also, Nephi's speech in 2 Nephi 26 is a reworking of Isaiah 29.<br />
Isaiah 29:3: And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee<br />
Isaiah 29:4: and thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust<br />
2 Nephi 26:15: after the Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them<br />
2 Nephi 26:16: For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust</p>
<p>Both Jacob and Helaman use Isaiah's phrase &quot;sure foundation.&quot;<br />
Isaiah 28:16: I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation<br />
Jacob 4:16-17: this stone shall become the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon which the Jews can build. And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner?<br />
Helaman 5:12: because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
<p>Isaiah is the only text in the Bible that uses the phrase &quot;by day and by night,&quot; but it also appears in Ether, despite the fact that the Jaredites predated Isaiah.<br />
Isaiah 28:18-19: when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it. From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.<br />
Ether 14:23: And the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon all the face of the land; wherefore the people became troubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof.</p>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, Jesus not only quotes Isaiah 52 (3 Nephi 20 and 21), but also Micah.<br />
Micah 4:12-13: But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.<br />
Micah 5:8-15: And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: and I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities. And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.<br />
3 Nephi 20:18-19: And I will gather my people together as a man gathereth his sheaves into the floor. For I will make my people with whom the Father hath covenanted, yea, I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass. And thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he who doeth it.<br />
3 Nephi 20:16-17: Then shall ye, who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them who shall be many; and ye shall be among them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.<br />
3 Nephi 21:12-18: And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries, and all their enemies shall be cut off. Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots; and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds; and I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy land, and thou shalt have no more soothsayers; thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee, and thou shalt no more worship the works of thy hands; and I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities.<br />
3 Nephi 21:21: And I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.</p>
<p>Jesus also instructs his disciples to write down the words of Malachi 3 and 4, which are quoted in 3 Nephi 24 and 25. However, this poses a problem, for the text states: &quot;These scriptures, which ye had not with you, the Father commanded that I should give unto you; for it was wisdom in him that they should be given unto future generations&quot; (3 Nephi 26:2). Scholars have determined that Malachi was written after the Jews returned from their exile, sometime between the rebuilding of the temple and the return of Nehemiah (515-445 B.C.). Jesus was correct, therefore, in stating that the Nephites did not have these scriptures. Nonetheless, Nephi quotes from Malachi.</p>
<p>Malachi 4:1-2: For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts. <br />
1 Nephi 22:15: For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh speedily that Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of men; for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must be burned.<br />
1 Nephi 22:24: the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall<br />
2 Nephi 25:13: he shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings<br />
2 Nephi 26:4, 6, 9: Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble.&#8230;they shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.&#8230;But the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them</p>
<p>A further problem with the chapters of Malachi quoted by Jesus is the fact that Joseph Smith stated in his official history that when Moroni first appeared to him, Moroni quoted Malachi 4 &quot;with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles&quot; (JS-H 1:36). So the text of Malachi that Jesus gave the Nephites was the incorrect version contained in the KJV.</p>
<p>Another textual mix-up involves Deuteronomy 18. Both Nephi and Jesus quote a version of the passage that actually appears in Acts.<br />
Deuteronomy 18:15-19: The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; according to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not. And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken. I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.<br />
Acts 3:20-24: And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.<br />
1 Nephi 22:20-21: And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all those who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among the people. And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of whom Moses spake was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall execute judgment in righteousness.<br />
3 Nephi 20:23-26: Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among the people. Verily I say unto you, yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have testified of me. And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. The Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities</p>
<p>Although Moses does not identify the coming prophet, both Nephi and Jesus, like Peter, identify the prophet as Christ. Both Nephi and Jesus follow Acts in this core phrasing: &quot;like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that.&quot; Note also that Jesus restores the words &quot;of your brethren,&quot; which Nephi omits, and, like Peter, uses &quot;every soul,&quot; rather than Nephi's &quot;all those.&quot; However, Jesus follows Nephi in saying &quot;shall be cut off,&quot; rather than using Peter's words, &quot;shall be destroyed.&quot; Jesus also gives a modified version of Peter's words in Acts 3:24-26.</p>
<p>2 Nephi 4 is a good example of the manner in which the Book of Mormon strings together phrases from the Bible.</p>

<p>The Book of Mormon also employs some favorite phrases with high frequency. For example, in the entire Bible, including both Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha, phrases with &quot;came to pass&quot; occur 480 times, but 1,355 times in the Book of Mormon. The phrases &quot;and now&quot; and &quot;and now, behold&quot; occur 160 times in the Bible, but 650 times in the Book of Mormon. The phrase &quot;face of the earth&quot; occurs 33 times in the Bible and 49 times in the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon adds another 82 occurrences of &quot;face of the land&quot; and &quot;face of this land,&quot; which do not appear in the Bible at all. Phrases with &quot;depths of&quot; occur 8 times in the Bible and 27 times in the Book of Mormon. The phrase &quot;all manner of&quot; occurs 47 times in the Bible and 110 times in the Book of Mormon. And it must be remembered that the Book of Mormon is only about one-third the size of the Bible.</p>
<p>It is evident that a very large portion of the words in the Book of Mormon come from the Bible, both Old and New Testaments.</p>
