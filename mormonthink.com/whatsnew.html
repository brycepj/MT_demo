<p><strong>Ballard's talk on lipstick for women and the invention of the computer - 10/29/15</strong></p>
<p class="indent">SALT LAKE CITY - Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#160;spoke&#160;Tuesday morning at the&#160;ninth&#160;World Congress of Families&#160;being held in Salt Lake City.&#160;Several thousand participants have gathered at the Grand America Hotel for the four-day meeting, which features 185 speakers comprised of scholars, researchers and religious leaders.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the Church doesn't say the embarrassing thing Elder Ballard said regarding how women should wear lipstick to attract a man, how the apostles caused it to rain in Ethiopia and how the computer was invented in order to serve the Church's geneological needs.</p>

<p><strong>Joseph the Seer? - youtube video - 8/18/15</strong></p>
<p class="indent">With all the publicity by the LDS Church surrounding the recent publication of photos of the actual seer stone Joseph Smith used, here is a refreshing, interesting and informative discussion with independent Mormon historians, including Dan Vogel, examining the recent disclosure of pictures of seer-stone used by Joseph Smith in translating the Book of Mormon. This video has been added to the Book of Mormon Translation section.</p>
<p><span class="indent"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LKy1ySuitk">Joseph the Seer?</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Joseph the Seer - October Ensign article - 8/4/15</strong></p>
<p class="indent">More &quot;coming clean&quot; by the LDS Church. This one is about Joseph's use of the seer/peep stone. Look for this article to appear in the October 2015 Ensign. </p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Editor Comment: </strong>This is a fairly revealing article and actually mentions Joseph putting a seer stone in his hat to translate th Book of Mormon. Three questions we have:</p>
<p class="indent">1) The article shows several images of the 'incorrect' methods shown in the past where Joseph was depicted translating the BofM without using a stone and a hat. They mention the 'stone in the hat' method in the article but why are they still not showing a correct image of Joseph using the stone in the hat? Why do they only go halfway in their disclosure?</p>
<p class="indent">2) The article has several paragraphs discussing what happened to the original seer stone. They conclude with &quot;Since that time (Brigham Young's time), subsequent Church leaders have acknowledged the Church's ownership of the seer stone.&quot; However, why don't they simply say the Church has it now and how it is used or not used by the leaders of the Church instead of quoting from Brigham Young's time?</p>
<p class="indent">3) There is no discussion as to how this ordinary stone (found on Willard Chase's property when Joseph and Hyrum Smith were digging a well for Mr. Chase) had some sort of supernatural seering ability? This stone was not one of the original special stones preserved in the Stone Box by the Nephites for 2,000 years, so why would it work to translate ancient records from one language to another? Does it still work today? Members of the church might want to know this. The information presented in the article is new to many members, as it was not commonly or officially ever taught to the church membership before now, and does create some problematic challenges to the foundational claims of the church that we were all taught in Sunday School. The church should discuss this in more depth.</p>
<p class="indent">We think that members would be very interested in hearing more about where this stone is today and actually seeing this important artifact in a LDS museum. Without showing images of Joseph translating using the seer stone in a hat, discussing how it came to be and why it had seering abilities, nor discussing it's current status &amp; potential use by the current leaders and also by not publicly displaying it in a visitor's center or other church BLDG, we must conclude that the church is still somewhat embarrassed by it.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many other issues that become problematic when the actual BofM translation method is known such as why were the gold plates even necessary when they were never actually used in the translation process, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Scientology and Mormonism
-5/5/15</strong></p>
<p class="indent">In April 2015, HBO made a very informative documentary on Scientology entitled '<a href="http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/going-clear#/">Going Clear</a>'. The documentary involved many former high-ranking members of Scientology that have since left the organization and are speaking out against it. They interviewed several former members who describe an organization that ended up being very different than they thought it was when they joined it. After the documentary &quot;Going Clear&quot; aired, it became apparent that many former and questioning Latter-day Saints saw similarities with Mormonism to the things being exposed in the Church of Scientology.&#160;</p>

<p>Howe's infamous book has often been labeled as 'anti-Mormon' by LDS defenders like Hugh Nibley. However, it is referenced many times in books written by faithful LDS historians like Richard Bushman. The average member doesn't know exactly what to think of the book as many of the things in Howe's book have now been confirmed from faithful sources. We are very much looking forward to reading a critical analysis of this landmark book by award-winning, Mormon historian Dan Vogel when it comes out on April 20, 2015. </p>

<p><strong>VIDEO: Ancient Ruins and the Book of Mormon - Dan Vogel - 3/2/15</strong></p>
<p>Award-winning author Dan Vogel has released his latest video on Mormonism which we have added to our section on the Book of Mormon issues.</p>
<p class="indent">The purpose of this video is to explore what was known about the ruins and antiquities of the New World before Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon in 1829, and how that information compares with what is claimed in the Book of Mormon. In other words, does the Book of Mormon's content demand an extensive knowledge of New World antiquities beyond what was known by Joseph Smith's contemporaries?</p>

<p><strong>The Stone Box - 2/23/15</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Little has been written about the actual stone box that the gold plates were preserved in for 1,400 years. Many wonder what happened to it.

<p><strong><span>Moroni and the Swastika: Mormons in Nazi Germany</span> - 2/20/15</strong></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span id="productTitle7"><em>Moroni and the Swastika: Mormons in Nazi Germany</em></span><em> </em> by <span data-width="">David Conley Nelson Ph.D</span></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Summary: </strong>While Adolf Hitler's National Socialist government was persecuting Jews and Jehovah's Witnesses and driving forty-two small German religious sects underground, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continued to practice unhindered. How some fourteen thousand Mormons not only survived but thrived in Nazi Germany is a story little known, rarely told, and occasionally rewritten within the confines of the Church's history&#8212;for good reason, as we see in David Conley Nelson's <em>Moroni and the Swastika</em>. A page-turning historical narrative, this book is the first full account of how Mormons avoided Nazi persecution through skilled collaboration with Hitler's regime, and then eschewed postwar shame by constructing an alternative history of wartime suffering and resistance.</p>

<p>This <em>Sunstone</em> article from June 1996 is by LDS historian Michael Quinn. He gives a fascinating insight into tithing in the early days of the Church.</p>
<p>Church finances have not always been as they are today. Imagine today's Church if: tithing were 2 percent, converts had to give all their surplus to the Church, bishops were paid 8 percent of the ward's tithing, patriarchs charged fees, and each April the Church released a detailed financial report</p>

<p><strong>Dan Vogel video on the Book of Mormon Witnesses - 9/30/14</strong></p>
<p>Award-wining author Dan Vogel has just come out with his latest video. In this first of two parts, Dan examines the Three Book of Mormon witnesses and does an in-depth analysis of their testimony.</p>
<p>Since its publication in 1830, the Book of Mormon has been accompanied by the Testimony of Three Witnesses claiming to have seen the an angel with the plates and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses claiming that Joseph Smith showed them the plates, which they were allowed to handle. However, subsequent statements by members of both groups of witnesses indicate that the published Testimonies can be misleading and that using them to recreate the historical events behind them is a mistake. In fact, there is significant evidence that the experiences of the Three Witnesses was more subjective than their published Testimony implies and that the Eight Witnesses' examination of the plates was not completely natural and physical.</p>

<p><strong>Dan Vogel video on Book of Mormon translation. - 6/3/14</strong></p>
<p>Eyewitness testimony confirms that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon in the same manner that he once hunted for buried treasure: that is, with his brown-colored seer stone placed in the crown of his white top hat and his face snug to its brim. Rather than seeing treasures in the bowels of the earth, Smith claimed he saw luminous words on the stone, which he read to a scribe. In this manner the entire Book of Mormon as we have it came into existence. This fact conflicts with Joseph Smith's official history, which claims that he used magic spectacles&#8212;which he euphemistically called Urim and Thummim&#8212;attached to a breastplate. This video examines the historical sources and responds to recent apologetic attempts to reconcile this problem. </p>

<p><strong>Book of Mormon Translation - 12/30/13</strong></p>
<p>The Church just released the 4th essay addressing troubling issues in its history. An essay on the mechanical process in which the Book of Mormon was translated is now in the topical guide of the LDS.org website. It is found here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation">Book of Mormon Translation</a></p>
<p>The article is fairly brief and only superficially addresses the problem. For example the article states that a spectacle &quot;urim &amp; thummim&quot; was used to translate the BOM as well as a common stone discovered in the ground. First the essay mentions how special the spectacle version of the urim &amp; Thummim was:</p>
<p>&quot;kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord&quot; and &quot;handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages.&quot;<a href="#17"></a></p>
<p>Then the essay introduces the 'seer stone':</p>
<p>&quot;The other instrument, which Joseph Smith discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates, was a small oval stone, or &quot;seer stone.&quot; As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure. As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture.&quot;</p>
<p>But the Church does not bring up an obvious natural question this would bring up:<br /></p>
<p>Why would a common stone &quot;discovered in the ground&quot; have the same prophetic seering abilities as the spectacle urim &amp; thummim which was &quot;&quot;kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord&quot; and &quot;handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages&quot;?</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Plural Marriage and Families in Early Utah - 12/17/13</strong></p>
<p>The Church just released the 3rd essay addressing troubling issues in its history. An essay on Polygamy is now in the topical guide of the LDS.org website. It is found here: <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-and-families-in-early-utah">Plural Marriage and Families in Early Utah</a></p>
<p>The article is fairly brief and focuses on polygamy between 1847 and 1890 (after Joseph Smith). The article states &quot;Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God's purposes for instituting, through His prophets, the practice of plural marriage during the 19th century.&quot; </p>
<p>The article postulates that per the Book of Mormon, polygamy may have been instituted to increase the population. However, this makes little sense because a group of women can have far more children if they each have their own husband instead of sharing one man. For example Brigham Young reportedly had 55 children by some 29 child-bearing capable wives but had those women had their own husbands they may have had 150 or more children in total. This reasoning only makes sense if there was a shortage of men but <a href="joseph-smith-polygamy.html#more">census records show</a> that there were always more men than women in Utah during that time period.</p>
<p>The article completely avoids the most troubling issue that knowledgeable LDS have on polygamy which is the way Joseph Smith practiced it. Joseph Smith practiced polyandry where he married other men's wives as well as polygamy. Joseph married 33 women of which 11 were married to other men. Although many LDS believe that Joseph did not have sexual relations with those women, many faithful historians acknowledge that there is evidence he did. Often Joseph would send men on missions overseas then marry their wives. Also not mentioned is Joseph's marriages to young girls as young as 14 and to what lengths Joseph went to hide these marriages from his first wife Emma. Also omitted is how the Church leaders denied practicing polygamy before the 1850s.</p>
<p>The article also makes it seem that all the LDS women were more than willing to practice the principle and to defend it. They omit very sad stories of women like 14 year-old <a href="joseph-smith-polygamy.html#teens">Helen Kimball</a> who was pressured to marry Joseph Smith and to keep it a secret as she was promised exaltation for her family and faithful men like <a href="joseph-smith-polygamy.html#other">Henry Jacobs </a>who had his wife Zina taken from him and sealed to Joseph Smith and later to Brigham Young. </p>

<p><strong>Race and the Priesthood - 12/8/13</strong></p>
<p>The Church just released the 2nd essay addressing troubling issues in its history. An essay on Race and the Priesthood is now in the topical guide of the LDS.org website. Unfortunately, it is a fairly brief discussion and it only really addresses one problem of the Church denying blacks the priesthood until 1978. It is found here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood">Race and the Priesthood</a></p>
<p>The article disavows that the curse of Cain is black skin. Although not addressed is the Book of Mormon verses that specifically describe the curse as 'dark skin'.</p>
<p>The essay is basically a historical recap of the Church's treatment of blacks regarding the priesthood. Unfortunately the article does not say why the prophets from Brigham Young until Spencer Kimball denied blacks the priesthood when Joseph Smith allowed it in at least two instances. </p>
<p>Most of the issues discussed in MormonThink's section on <a href="blackweb.html">Blacks and the Priesthood</a> are still not addressed at all in this Church article.</p>

<p><strong>Swedish Rescue commentary by Sandra Tanner - 10/21/13</strong></p>
<p>In the October 2013 issue #121 of the <em>Salt Lake Messenger</em>, a publication by the Utah Lighthouse Ministry, they give a very nice recap of the Swedish Rescue and the 15 questions address during the fireside. The newsletter also discussed some related issues. The issue is well worth reading, even if you have already read the Swedish Rescue information on MormonThink, as I found their commentary to be very insightful and provided interesting comments we didn't think about before. <a href="glossary/swedish-rescue2.html#utlm">Link to updated section by Sandra Tanner</a></p>

<p><strong>New video on Joseph bringing the Gold Plates Home - 9/23/14</strong></p>
<p>The following very informative video by noted Mormon historian Dan Vogel describes the circumstances surrounding how Joseph first brought the plates to his family's house in 1827. This video is now in several sections of MT, including this one:</p>
<p><a href="runningweb.html#vogelbringplates">Video on Joseph bringing the Gold Plates Home</a> </p>
<p>Video Description:</p>
<p>Joseph Smith claimed he translated the Book of Mormon from anciently engraved gold plates, which he took from a stone box in the side of a hill near his home in Manchester, New York. Claiming that he was forbidden by God to show them to anyone, Smith kept the plates carefully wrapped in a cloth or concealed in a wooden box. Believers accept this as God's way of requiring faith, whereas skeptics suspect Smith constructed a set of plates that couldn't pass visual inspection. This is the story of Joseph Smith's bringing the plates home in September 1827.</p>

<p><strong>School of the Prophets - 8/21/13</strong></p>

<p><strong>Joseph Smith, Captain Kidd, Cumorah And Moroni - by Grant Palmer 8/9/13</strong></p>
<p>Folktales of the treasure feats of Captain William Kidd (1645-1701), and their likely influence upon Joseph Smith Jr., have previously been argued and written during the last several decades. While the topic is not new, circumstantial evidence linking the two men is accumulating. This article is not the last word on the subject, but rather an effort to clarify where things presently stand. &#160;READ: <a href="grant11.html">article by Grant Palmer</a></p>

<p><strong>Professor Givens' &quot;Crucible of Doubt&quot; UK Tour on the &quot;new&quot; Church History &#8211; 6/11/13</strong></p>
<p>During May 2013, under the apparent direction of the Church, LDS apologist Terryl Givens and his wife Fiona toured the UK and Ireland giving firesides on the 'Crucible of Doubt'. MormonThink received many emails after these firesides, including a link to an audio tape made by a member in attendance. The firesides appeared to be apologetic in nature mentioning that there are some historical issues coming to light in the LDS Church which is causing members to doubt the Church.&#160; <span class="red">An e-mail was sent to all leadership that no missionaries, investigators or youth should attend.&#160;</span><a href="glossary/crucible-of-doubt.html">Click here for more information</a></p>

<p><strong>First Vision Essay - 11/29/12</strong></p>
<p>R. L. Pratt's essay on the First Vision discusses issues such as throughout the Nineteenth Century, Elohim was thought to be a name synonymous with Jehovah. But in 1916, Church authorities issued out a Doctrinal Exposition saying in effect that Elohim was actually an altogether different person; a higher-yet god.....a god above Jehovah. <a href="firstvisionweb.html#sabellianism">Read Joseph Smith Sabellianism and Mormon Belief</a></p>
