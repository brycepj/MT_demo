<p><img src="http://mormonthink.com/img/scottc.jpg" alt="Scott" width="220" height="250" align="left" style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px"/> For almost a decade, MormonThink has provided information about LDS Church history that few members know. I will continue that important work because members deserve to know the truth so they can make informed choices. The LDS Church is trying to rectify some of these discrepancies through the essays they began releasing in 2013. It is my hope that the LDS Church will become completely transparent about its past. Until that time, MormonThink will continue to do their job.</p>
<p>MormonThink is a valuable resource and I want to make it even more effective by providing commentary and editorials that rely on accurate historical research and an understanding of LDS doctrine. One must bear in mind that there is no completely impartial perspective on history&#8212;we tend to interpret the past through our modern understanding and our personal lens. On the other hand, there is good research, and there is poor research. Good research is guided by facts; to make assertions about what did or did not happen, good historians look for consistency across a range of primary sources. Good historians also strive to be comprehensive, to view every piece of information they find to help them better understand what they study. One of the main goals of MormonThink is to acquaint readers with solid research on the LDS Church, and to critique faulty, problematic research. While the editors and contributing authors of MormonThink are not academicians, it is our intent to be as scholarly as possible in content and tone.</p>
<p>MT has grown in popularity in recent years, with 2+ million hits per month peaking at 3.7M hits in February, 2014, so it's even more important that we keep up with the latest information and research on LDS historical and doctrinal issues.</p>
<p>I welcome your commentary and rebuttals to all viewpoints represented on this site (use the link at the bottom of this page to email me). I look forward to interacting with many of you online.</p>
<h3>More about Scott</h3>
<p>I was a life-long member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until 5 May 2015 (more on that below). My parents converted a couple of years before I was born. We faithfully attended our meetings and my parents faithfully fulfilled their callings. My father was in the US Navy and we moved around a bit. When I was 13 my father retired and moved the family to Logan, Utah. A short time later my parents became endowed and we were sealed as a family in the Logan temple.</p>
<p>As a child and youth, I really didn't think much about the church one way or another, it was just something my family did: some families bowl on Wednesday nights, our family went to church on Sundays. I had friends who attended, so it seemed more a social time than anything else. It felt pretty much like going to school&#8212;something I was supposed to do.</p>
<p>In high school I went to seminary for a little over a year, but schooling wasn't my thing. I dropped out of seminary and took the lightest class load I could get away with and graduate. I moved to Phoenix, Arizona to attend a vocational school in architectural drafting and design. I had no plans on going on a mission. However, I worked with a return missionary and the more I thought about it, the more interested I became in a mission. I graduated from the vocational school, sent in my mission papers in 1985 then went to New Zealand for two years.</p>
<p>I had not read the entire Book of Mormon before I left for my mission. While in the MTC I read it. And prayed about it. And fasted. But I received no witness as promised by Moroni. I thought I was at fault. I talked to my leader in the MTC and confessed every minor sin, problem and issue I could think of. I continued to fast and pray and read the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>I left the MTC and arrived in New Zealand. I read the mission-approved books I brought along: Jesus the Christ, The Article of Faith and the scriptures. I was obedient to the mission rules. I continued to pray, ponder, fast and read. But no matter what I did, I never had a spiritual manifestation or witness that the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith or the Church was true. I studied talks and books about recognizing the spirit, because maybe it was just that I wasn't recognizing it. </p>
<p>I had always been an ardent reader with a fascination for history instilled by my father. While on my mission I came across several books, such as Book of Mormon Authorship published by the Religious Studies Center at Brigham Young University. I was fascinated by the information in that book.</p>
<p>I arrived home and began to seriously pursue learning everything I could about the LDS Church's history and doctrine. This was in the age before the Internet, so almost all of my books were purchased from Deseret Book or used book stores. FARMS had catalogs listing their publications, mostly mimeographed articles. I purchased as much as I could afford. Within a short time I had nearly 300 books and hundreds of articles, all published by faithful Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>Through reading this material, I learned many things about the Church that was not being taught in Sunday School or in my High Priest quorum. These were things that were not mentioned over the pulpit in Sacrament Meeting or General Conference. And I wondered why. In fact, I began to question many things about church history and doctrine. I tried finding answers through study, faith and prayer.</p>
<p>The &quot;answers&quot; I found in what I read, written by faithful LDS scholars and apologists, often seemed convoluted: the twisting of facts and ideas, and the direct contradiction of what was taught in Church meetings, seemed more rationalizations than explanations. </p>
<p>Sometime around 2002 I realized that an intellectual &quot;testimony&quot; through reading and studying would never give me the spiritual witness and testimony I longed for. So I stopped purchasing books and articles but continued to fast, pray, read my scriptures and attend the temple regularly. I faithfully fulfilled callings in the ward (mainly in bishoprics and as Gospel Doctrine teacher) and stake. I stayed an active, faithful member throughout my studying, longing for the personal testimony others frequently talked about. I also followed Elders Oaks' and Packer's suggestion that gaining a testimony could come by sharing a testimony. But a spiritual witness has never come.</p>
<p>During my years in the Church from post-mission through my most recent activity there was always a sense of disconnect between what I believed the &quot;Gospel&quot; was all about and what I heard and saw exhibited from the members around me. I took to heart the belief that &quot;charity&quot; was &quot;the pure love of Christ&quot; (Moroni 7:47-48). Coupling that with the concept that we are trying to become like God (John 10:33-34; 2 Peter 1:4; Acts 17:29; Romans 8:16-17), and God Himself is love (1 John 4:7-10), I fully believed that I wanted to do things because I loved the people I was doing things for. However, the people around me more frequently seemed to say and act that the reason for being obedient or doing things for others is because then &quot;you will be blessed&quot; for such things. To me, this was in essence purchasing one's way into heaven. People were acting the way they did because they expected something in return. And this I thought was a perversion of the teachings concerning charity and I had a hard time reconciling such behavior and talk.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, since the time I decided to go on a mission, my life had revolved around the church. My vocation (public school teacher) and spouse were chosen based on my commitment to, and experiences surrounding, the gospel of Jesus Christ. The raising of my children and my personal moral code were grounded in LDS teachings. My life was committed to and shaped by those teachings and the community of other Latter-day Saint believers. I am grateful for the forces that have shaped who I have become.</p>
<p>One way in which I was shaped was a strong sense of integrity. But slowly I felt my integrity crumble as I continued to teach and testify about things I questioned and doubted concerning the Church's historical and doctrinal claims and their stances on current social issues. And I was confused that an organization espousing truth, honesty and integrity, had problems with those very traits. Such concerns would cause any thoughtful, curious person to continue questioning.</p>
<p>With a preponderance of material available shedding light on actual Church history, the Church cannot claim they do not know about certain aspects of their history. And yet, many of those aspects are not openly shared. Instead, what is often given as reasons for why &quot;difficult&quot; things are not taught is that members need milk before meat. But the &quot;milk before meat&quot; mentality falls down when truth is suppressed or lies are told to hide the &quot;meat.&quot; In discussions with apologists, I often hear that it is a member's fault if they do not know certain aspects of the Church's history or doctrine. But how can members be blamed when the correlated curriculum is not 100% transparent concerning all historical and doctrinal issues and members are discouraged from seeking sources outside that curriculum? (See <a href="../responses/joseph-smith-polygamy-church-sources.html">my essay</a> about this very idea after the Church published an essay about polygamy in Nauvoo in October 2014 and people blamed members for not already knowing all the details surrounding Joseph Smith's polygamy.)</p>
<p>I personally discovered many aspects of Church history and doctrine because I was intellectually curious and I had the means to pay for the information (this was before the age of the internet). Through the internet, where information is virtually free, there is no reason why there are still so many things about Church history and doctrine that are unknown by the general Church membership. I believe all members should have available to them all of the accurate information about the Church that is known so they can decide for themselves how they want to live their lives in relation to Mormonism. Ultimately, a more informed member will be more committed to the course they choose to pursue. MormonThink plays an important role in offering resources to help members make their choice.</p>
<p>I am continuing my journey of discovery about the LDS Church through occasional attendance, serious reflection, a return to deep study and probing questions. I believe MormonThink has picked up the gauntlet thrown down by J. Reuben Clark when he said, regarding the LDS Church, &quot;If we have the truth, [it] cannot be harmed by investigation.&quot; (J. Reuben Clark, D. Michael Quinn, J. Reuben Clark: The Church Years. Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1983, p. 24)</p>
<p>I believe that Church authorities should show generosity and goodwill to truth seekers like myself, and to those of us who need time away from active participation in the religion so that we can participate in our own learning, investigating and thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Update 5 May 2015</strong></p>
<p>In March 2014 that LDS Church supported legislation that was touted as protecting LGBTQI people from discrimination along with providing &quot;religious freedom&quot; protection. In reality, this legislation was merely insurance that those who claimed religious reasons could discriminate against LGBTQI people. (See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865623399/Utah-lawmakers-unveil-anti-discrimination-religious-rights-legislation.html?pg=all">this article</a> in the <em>Deseret News</em> concerning this PR move by the LDS Church). The following month, during the Church's April 2015 General Conference, Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said, &quot;We want our voice to be heard against all of the counterfeit and alternative lifestyles that try to replace the family organization that God Himself established.&quot; (&quot;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/why-marriage-and-family-matter-everywhere-in-the-world">Why Marriage and Family Matter&#8212;Everywhere in the World</a>&quot;) While seeming to champion LGBTQI rights in March, in April one of the Church's mouthpiece for God said that marriage among LGBTQI people was &quot;counterfeit.&quot; And the week following this talk, the Church filed an amicus brief supporting a ban on same-sex marriage. (&quot;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/religious-freedom-and-fairness-for-all">Religious Freedom and Fairness for All</a>,&quot; article found on the Church's official Newsroom website.)
<p>At that time I could no longer in good conscience have my name attached to an organization that is bigoted. I want nothing to do with a group that cannot live the principles that Jesus Christ, whom they claim is the head of their church, taught - to love everyone unconditionally. I have frequently heard, "We love the person but not the sin." But this is <strong>not</strong> unconditional love. As soon as one labels a person's behavior as "sin," they have already cast judgment on that person as a sinner. This immediately creates a barrier between that renders unconditional love unattainable.</p>
<p>Even though I felt I could no longer be a member, I spent several weeks agonizing over what to do. This effects not only me but my family as well. However, on 25 April 2015 I emailed Church headquarters asking for my name to be removed. On 5 May 2015 I received word from Church headquarters that my name had been removed.</p>
<p>Regardless of my current membership status, I remain committed to the same editorial oversight I have outlined in the opening paragraphs of this page. See our glossary on <a href="../glossary/ad-hominem.html">ad hominem</a>.</p>
