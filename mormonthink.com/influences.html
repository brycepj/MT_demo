<p>by Thomas E. Donofrio</p>
<p>Solomon Spalding (1761-1816) is considered by some researchers to be the original author of the Book of Mormon. One aspect not addressed in the research is that Spalding engages in an acceptable practice of the day, namely heavy borrowing and outright plagiarism. This will have implications for the validity of wordprint studies comparing Spalding's manuscript and the Book of Mormon. Spalding demonstrates a lack of originality both in vocabulary and concept. The evidence for this is illustrated by comparing his manuscript to the <em>History of the Rise, Progress and Termination of the American Revolution</em>, published in 1805 by Mercy Otis Warren (1728-1814).</p>
<p>Warren, noted for her elegant prose, politely lectures the reader, in addition to relating history. She uses her <em>History</em> as a forum to enlighten the current generation with her &quot;moral observations&quot; on republicanism, power, greed, mankind, Christianity, good versus evil, and the plight of the American Indian. She implores the reader to not forget the hard-fought lessons of the revolution, lest freedom be lost. Also, Warren fears that a newly acquired prosperity will corrupt this generation. In effect, her <em>History</em> is a sermon preaching that God was instrumental in delivering the colonies and that avarice and ambition are the motives that impelled the Crown to engage in a wanton struggle of subjugation and slavery.</p>
<p>Spalding, a veteran of the Revolution, borrows from Warren as he relates his view on the war, using fictional Indians as the vehicle. Spalding is not so much interested in giving an accurate account of Indian history as he is in emulating Warren. Spalding imputes into his Indians motives and creates situations similar to the motives and Revolutionary War scenes described in Warren's history. Spalding, not content with borrowing her concepts, lifts her prose as well. As a result, his own moral melodrama emerges as a poor copy.</p>

<p>The following comparisons will illustrate Spalding's appropriation of Warren. Both authors deliver introductory remarks, and, true to form, Spalding follows Warren's example. Her six page preface is entitled &quot;An address to the Inhabitants of the United States.&quot; Spalding's preface is less than half as long and simply titled &quot;Introduction.&quot; (In this section, page numbers from Warren's book are from the 1805 edition. Underlined text from Spalding indicates words that were stricken out in the original manuscript).</p>

<p>On page 234 of her <em>History</em>, Warren describes George Washington as a &quot;Fabius,&quot; in reference to the Roman general. It so happens that Spalding selects Fabius as the name of his main character in the <em>Manuscript </em>. Warren at other times mentions Rome and Romans. Spalding builds his story around Romans landing accidentally in America instead of their original destination of Britain.</p>
<p>On page 226, Warren condemns the British for squandering an opportunity to spread Christianity. In the <em>Manuscript</em>, Chapter VIII, a great teacher named Lobaska enlightens the people.</p>

<p>On page 220, Warren gives an account of the London riots of 1780. She notes that religious intolerance by Protestants toward Catholics was demonstrated by their outward wearing of blue cockades in their hats. The Protestant Associators, in addition to wearing the badge, engaged in social protest and destruction of property. Spalding has a similar incident in his <em>Manuscript</em>, when two groups of Indians prepare for war over the wearing of a blue feather.</p>

<td valign-top="valign-top">It had been the custom for several ages for the King and chiefs of the Kentucks to have the exclusive right to wear in their caps a bunch of blue feathers, which designated their preeminence over every nation. The Siotan princes envying them this distinguished honor &amp; considering themselves as being at least their equals assumed the liberty to place bunches of Blue feathers upon their caps. This in the opinion of the Kentucks was an unpardonable offense... <br />
Thus saith Bombal, the king...Ye have insulted <strong>my</strong> our honor &amp; dignity, in assuming blue feathers which was the badge of our preeminence... (Chap. VIII)</td>

<p>Spalding's Lobaska intervenes to prevent bloodshed between the groups. Note that the material in Warren is clustered from page 220 to 226, as is Spalding's in Chapter VIII.</p>
<p>The major war in the <em>Manuscript</em> involves a love triangle between an evil king, a princess and a prince. The prince and princess, Elseon and Lamesa, elope, causing two nations to go to war. At one point, the princess expresses her fear that her husband and her father may eventually become combatants. She has the prince promise not to kill her father or brother should they meet on the battlefield. The prince promises to spare their lives, if he encounters them.</p>
<p>Warren relates the story of Count Kosciusco, a Polish military officer, who joined the revolution on the side of the colonies. Prior to coming to America, Kosciusco experienced a situation similar to the story of Elseon and Lamesa. This scene in Warren's <em>History</em> appears to be the inspiration for the episode in Spalding's <em>Manuscript</em>.</p>

When Kosciusco found he must either surrender the object of his affection, or take the life of her parent, humanity prevailed over his passion, he returned the sword to its scabbard, and generously relinquished the beautiful daughter to her distressed father, rather than become the murderer of the person who gave being to so much elegance and beauty, now plunged in terror and despair from the tumult of contending passions...

<p>Taken individually, the previous parallels could be explained away as common usage of the day or chance occurrence. However, the more they occur, particularly when they fall into a pattern or cluster, the more it strengthens the argument that Spalding was taking his cues from Mercy Warren.

<p>At this point Spalding should receive some benefit of the doubt. Warren certainly did not invent all of the previous phrases. In fact, many of these terms can be found throughout colonial writing. David Ramsay(1749-1815) published his own <em>History of the American Revolution</em> sixteen years prior to Warren. Much of the same verbiage can be found in his work, although it is less eloquent. It is likely that Warren used Ramsay as a reference, given the fact that she was well-read. It is the eloquence of Mercy Warren that tips the scale in favor of Spalding having selected her style. To follow suit, &quot;Let imagination paint&quot; a picture of Spalding, a sickly, impoverished, old veteran, reading Warren late into the evening by candlelight. Her lovely words and prose impress his mind. He recognizes her success as an author and is inspired to spin his own tale of the conflict he experienced. Spalding's Kentucks and Sciotans represent the Americans and British. The Kentucks are presented as innocents attacked by a greedy, jealous king of the Sciotans, representing the king of England. As Spalding builds his story, he leans on Warren to fill deficiencies in his writing ability.</p>
<p>Spalding was not original even when his main character Fabius delivers a racial slur. Fabius laments that he and his shipwrecked crew are doomed to remain among people that resemble &quot;the Orang outang.&quot; This term was evidently in circulation. In an essay on education, Robert Coram (1761-1796) postulates: </p>
<blockquote>...if the present race of American Indians should shortly become extinct, it would be impossible for posterity to form any judgment of them, whether they were a species of orangutan or rational beings.</blockquote>
<p>Spalding's story begins with Roman sailors landing on the American continent and their first contact with indigenous people. Similarly, both Warren and Ramsay also begin their histories with ocean-sailing pilgrims and their discovery of Indians. If Spalding were following a pattern, it is natural that his voyagers would land on New World shores and encounter natives, as was documented by Warren and Ramsay.</p>
<p>As the <em>Manuscript</em> progresses, Fabius and his troop live for two years among these natives. Eventually, they decide to explore and must leave their new friends. The departure scene is reminiscent of the farewell George Washington gave to his group of officers after the British surrender, as documented by Warren and Ramsay. Additionally, Ramsay repeats the scene in his <em>Life of George Washington</em>.</p>

<p>Even though Spalding demonstrates a heavy reliance on Warren, it is reasonable to assume that his predisposition to borrow would not be limited to her work. Spalding's Indian chiefs argue the merits of going to war in forms that resemble Parliamentary debate in England and the Continental Congress in America. For instance, in Chapter XII of the <em>Manuscript</em>, &quot;the venerable Boakim arose&quot; in council to question the worth of going to war over the princess Lamesa's elopement. Compare his opening remarks to those of Patrick Henry in his <em>Liberty or Death</em> speech.</p>

<p>Spalding was at one time a minister, and it is not surprising to find religious content in his <em>Manuscript</em>. In Chapter IV, his character Fabius paraphrases Bible verse. In a fit of despair, Fabius laments his condition by quoting a portion of Jeremiah 9:1.</p>

<p>To say Spalding borrowed from the Bible would be a true enough statement. However, something more subtle is occurring. Spalding is using a style common to preachers such as George Whitefield. In his sermon, <em>Marks of a True Conversion</em>, Whitefield bewails the condition of the sinners to whom he preaches. </p>
<blockquote>O that my head were waters, O that mine eyes were a fountain of tears, that I might weep over an unconverted, graceless, wicked, and adulterous generation.</blockquote>
<p>While this does not prove that Spalding borrowed from Whitefield, it does demonstrate that Spalding paraphrased Bible verse in the same style employed by famous preachers, such as George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards. These ministers would incorporate Bible verse in their sermons, often without reference. Different verses were sometimes combined, as they would flow and weave among the preacher's dialogue. Most times, the preacher did not bother to identify verse, as if assuming the flock would recognize it, when heard or read.</p>
<p>Solomon Spalding was no more guilty of borrowing than any other writer of his time. Documentation or giving credit was at the whim of the author. Mercy Warren was an exception to the rule. Even though her documentation was not up to modern standards, it exceeded the norm. Spalding often crossed out passages in his handwritten manuscript, leaving the modern reader to wonder if he changed his mind or was panged by a guilty conscience.</p>

The Book of Mormon: Historical Influences</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The charge of plagiarism has followed Joseph Smith from the time he produced the Book of Mormon in 1830. His detractors have pointed to the many biblical references contained in the book. Indeed, whole chapters, verses, and pieces of verses are reproduced. His defenders find no controversy, claiming that since it is the word of God, it is reasonable to find similarities in both works.</p>
<p>If Joseph were a plagiarist after all, would he have been content to borrow from the Bible exclusively, or would the temptation to lift from additional resources have been too great to resist?</p>
<p>The Book of Mormon deals with those two subjects that should never be discussed in polite company, namely, religion and politics. No matter who the author, or authors may be, their strong feelings on both subjects are expressed in the characters and situations in the book.</p>
<p>The charge of plagiarism is a difficult position to prove. The Book of Mormon at first read does have a biblical sound. It is presented as a record of Hebrew origin. This would lend support to the book's defense. However, when it is compared to written material from the era of 1830, it sounds less and less biblical and more and more contemporary. Words, phrases, and concepts in the following study place the Book of Mormon squarely in the time of its production. The following comparisons will make a &quot;word for word&quot; translation an impossible position to defend.</p>
<p>Defenders will rush to say that any similarities are nothing more than the &quot;language of the day.&quot; This is no doubt the case in many instances. Joseph Smith would have used the tools that were available at the time. But words are more than a group of letters, and groups of words are more than sentences. They convey meaning and concepts. The information in this study illustrates words and phrases in the Book of Mormon that reflect concepts and issues of a new United States. In the Bible, they are not used in the same context, or in many cases, do not even exist. Otherwise, ancient Americans, who the book states are descendants of Israelites, must have been no different than Revolutionary Americans of 1776. The comparisons indicate the Book of Mormon is a retelling of history, rather than a case of history repeating itself. The Book of Mormon may be considered as a moral melodrama. Out of concern for the present, an ancient people are sacrificed in order to teach lessons to modern readers. These ancient peoples fight the same battles for the same reasons as colonial Americans. They eventually lose the rights for which they fought hard. The modern reader is led to conclude that he will too, if he makes the same mistakes. The Book of Mormon itemizes those mistakes and offers their correction. It tackles issues under debate in early America and presents its own views as authoritative.</p>
<br />
<h3>Mercy Otis Warren</h3>
<p>In Part I, we saw that there are similarities in words, phrases, and themes between Spalding's <em>Manuscript</em> and the histories of Mercy Warren and David Ramsay. We can now demonstrate that there are numerous similarities of the same type in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>Compare the following parallels from Warren's <em>History</em> and the Book of Mormon. (Page numbers from Warren are from the 1989 Liberty Classics reprint.)</p>

<h3>David Ramsay</h3>
<p>As noted in Part I, it is probable that Mercy Warren used David Ramsay's <em>History of the American Revolution</em> as a source, since she repeats many of the same terms, phrases and concepts found in Ramsay's book. However, Ramsay's <em>History</em> also provides other parallels, in particular his references to George Washington. During the winter of 1776, Washington ordered an invasion of Quebec with the goal of driving out British troops. The command of this expedition was given to Benedict Arnold. The infamous turncoat and his army of one thousand endured extreme hardship while covering 180 miles of difficult terrain in bad conditions. After 45 days, Arnold entered Canada and delivered a letter from General Washington. Ramsay appears to have had a copy of Washington's letter. He refers to portions of it in his <em>History</em>, while relating the expedition of Colonel Arnold: &quot;A manifesto subscribed by general Washington, which had been sent from Cambridge with this detachment, was circulated among the inhabitants of Canada. In this they were invited to arrange themselves under the standard of general liberty; and they were informed that the American army was sent into the province, not to plunder but to protect them.&quot;1 These are the only parts of the letter that he paraphrases. The complete text of Washington's letter appears below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends and Brethren:</p>
<p>The unnatural Contest between the English Colonies, and Great Britain has now risen to such a height, that Arms alone must decide it.</p>
<p>The Colonies, confiding in the Justice of their Cause and the purity of their intentions, have reluctantly appealed to that Being, in whose hands are all Human Events: He has hitherto smiled upon their virtuous Efforts: The Hand of Tyranny has been arrested in its Ravages, and the British Arms, which have shone with so much Splendor in every part of the Globe, are now tarnished with disgrace and disappointment. Generals of approved experience, who boasted of subduing this great Continent, find themselves circumscribed within the limits of a single City and its Suburbs, suffering all the shame and distress of a Siege. While the Freeborn Sons of America, animated by the genuine principles of Liberty and Love of their Country, with increasing Union, Firmness and discipline, repel every attack and despise every Danger.</p>
<p>Above all we rejoice that our Enemies have been deceived with Regard to you: They have persuaded themselves, they have even dared to say, that the Canadians were not capable of distinguishing between the Blessings of Liberty and the Wretchedness of Slavery; that gratifying the Vanity of a little Circle of Nobility would blind the Eyes of the people of Canada. By such Artifices they hoped to bend you to their Views; but they have been deceived: Instead of finding in you that poverty of Soul, and baseness of Spirit, they see with a Chagrin equal to our Joy, that you are enlightened, generous, and Virtuous; that you will not renounce your own Rights, or serve as Instruments to deprive your Fellow subjects of theirs. Come then, my Brethren, Unite with us in an indissoluble Union. Let us run together to the same Goal. We have taken up Arms in Defence of our Liberty, our Property; our Wives and our Children: We are determined to preserve them or die. We look forward with pleasure to that day not far remote (we hope) when the Inhabitants of America shall have one Sentiment and the full Enjoyment of the blessings of a Free Government.</p>
<p>Incited by these Motives and encouraged by the advice of many Friends of Liberty among you, the Great American Congress have sent an Army into your Province, under the command of General Schuyler; not to plunder but to protect you; to animate and bring forth into Action those sentiments of Freedom you have declared, and which the Tools of despotism would extinguish through the whole Creation. To co-operate with this design and to frustrate those cruel and perfidious Schemes, which would deluge our Frontier with the Blood of Women and Children, I have detached Colonel Arnold into your Country, with a part of the Army under my Command. I have enjoined upon him, and am certain that he will consider himself, and act as in the Country of his Patrons and best Friends. Necessaries and Accommodations of every kind which you may furnish, he will thankfully receive, and render the full Value. I invite you as Friends and Brethren, to provide him with such supplies as your Country affords; and I pledge myself not only for your safety and security, but for ample Compensation. Let no Man desert his habitation. Let no Man flee as before an Enemy.</p>
<p>The cause of America and of liberty is the cause of every virtuous American Citizen. Whatever may be his Religion or his descent, the United Colonies know no distinction, but such as Slavery, Corruption and Arbitrary Domination may create. Come then ye generous Citizens, range yourselves under the Standard of general Liberty, against which all the force and Artifice of Tyranny will never be able to prevail. I am, etc. 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of Washington's eloquence the campaign ultimately failed.</p>
<p>So what, if anything, does this letter have to do with the Book of Mormon? A casual reader may have missed the parallels. A Book of Mormon expert will notice something more. For those less aware, the following comparisons are offered.</p>

<p>How can these similarities be explained? Is it possible that the author of the Book of Mormon had a copy of the letter and used it as a resource? Or, is this just &quot;the language of the day,&quot; as the defenders of Joseph would say. Perhaps it is more reasonable to assume that the letter or the themes contained therein were available in full or in part in other more accessible works. The concepts put forth by Washington may be considered universal. Many of them were used by the other Founding Fathers. Since the parallels cannot be denied, the information must have been available to the author of the Book of Mormon in some form.</p>
<p>Washington's letter has further significance in relation to the character Moroni in the Book of Mormon. Moroni, in an effort to rally his people, takes his cloak and writes on it the following words: &quot;In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children&quot; (Alma 46:12). Moroni then </p>
<blockquote>
<p>fastened it upon the end of a pole (Alma 46:12)</p>
<p>(and he called it the title of liberty)&quot; (Alma 46:13)</p>
<p>And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty to be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land...and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites. (Alma 46:36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Washington implores the Canadians to &quot;range yourselves under the Standard of general Liberty.&quot; Moroni has his own &quot;standard of liberty,&quot; and places his &quot;title of liberty&quot; on &quot;a pole.&quot; One of General Washington's many roving headquarters was the Liberty Pole Tavern, Englewood, New Jersey, 3 September 1780. Liberty poles were popular among the colonies. The Sons of Liberty stood guard over a liberty pole in New York, January 1770, defending it from vandalism by British soldiers. Writing on a flag was common. The words &quot;LIBERTY and UNION&quot; flew on the Taunton flag raised on a liberty pole in Massachusetts, 21 October 1744. The Liberty Tree flag declared, &quot;AN APPEAL TO GOD.&quot;</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-one, George Washington traveled down the Ohio river to deliver a warning letter to the commander of French forces. Washington's journal detailing this adventure was published as a pamphlet in Williamsburg, Virginia and was reproduced in two installments of the <em>Maryland Gazette</em> on March 21 and 28, 1754. Both Warren and Ramsay refer to the publication of this journal, but neither reproduces any text from it. Nonetheless, similarities can be found between it and the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>The Book of Mormon notes that chief captain Moroni was only twenty-five, when he took command of the Nephite army (Alma 43:17). Washington was in his early twenties, when he was commissioned commander in chief of colonial troops, and Moroni was also made &quot;chief commander&quot; (Alma 46:11).</p>
<p>David Ramsay was a friend and confederate of George Washington. He honored his old friend in <em>The Life of George Washington</em>, published eight years after Washington's death. Ramsay also produced <em>The History of the American Revolution</em>, 1789, in two volumes. An analysis of Ramsay's works reveals Book of Mormon parallels in addition to those of Washington's letter.</p>

<p>In his <em>History</em>, Ramsay blames the Tories for the war. </p>
<blockquote>It was the general opinion of the Americans, that the continuance of the war, and the asperity with which it had been carried on, was more owing to the machinations of their own countrymen, who had taken part with royal government, than to their British enemies. It is certain that the former had been most active in predatory excursions, and most forward in scenes of blood and murder...the authors of so great a share of the general distress. (p. 623)</blockquote>
Similarly, Moroni laments the insurrection of those who wanted to establish a king.
<blockquote>Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out among ourselves; yea, were it not for these king-men, who caused so much bloodshed among ourselves...had they been true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies, instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among ourselves...we should have dispersed our enemies. (Alma 60:16)</blockquote>
<p>Moroni's career mirrors Washington's: enemies within as well as without, lack of supplies, being outnumbered, similar defenses and battlefield tactics, and fighting for freedom over slavery. We may also note as a matter of historical record that Tecumseh was killed in the battle of Moraviantown, while in the Book of Mormon a character by the name of Teancum slays a foe named Morianton.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Founding Fathers</h3>
<p>Many of the themes expressed by George Washington are repeated by his contemporaries. Samuel Adams delivered his <em>American Independence</em> speech to the State House in Philadelphia on August 1, 1776.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson addressed problems with the Native Americans in his second inaugural speech (March 4, 1805).</p>
<blockquote>the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow its dictates, and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter; they are combated by the habits of their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel themselves something in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other. These persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did must be done through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance under its counsel in their physical, moral, or political condition is perilous innovation; that their duty is to remain as their Creator made them, ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger; in short, my friends, among them is also seen the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry; they too have their antiphilosophists who find an interest in keeping things in their present state, who dread reformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates. </blockquote>
<p>In the Book of Mormon, Jacob, the brother of Nephi, relates an encounter with a man named Sherem, who opposed Jacob and accused him of perverting the old laws and teaching new things. Jacob then says, &quot;that many means were devised to reclaim and restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an eternal hatred against us, their brethren&quot; (Jacob 7:24). Alma also views the Lamanites as clinging to tradition and ignorance: &quot;for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance....And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers&quot; (Alma 9:16-17).</p>
<p>There are further similarities between the Book of Mormon and Jefferson's first inaugural address (March 4, 1801).</p>

<h3>Jonathan Edwards</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most famous minister of the colonial period was Jonathan Edwards. His writings and intellect were heavily relied upon during the Second Great Awakening. Edwards' volume of works became more popular in the early 1800s than they were during his life. Much of his work was &quot;Methodized&quot; at that time.6</p>
<p>Edwards, in his sermon, <em>Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God</em>, describes those that sin as having &quot;hardness of heart and blindness of mind.&quot; Edwards couples Mark 16:14 (&quot;hardness of heart&quot;) with an apparent inverse of Calvin's enlightening &quot;inner teacher&quot; that &quot;opens the eyes of the mind.&quot;7 This same phrase can be found in the Book of Mormon, which uses language and concepts similar to Edwards' sermon.</p>

<h3>George Whitefield</h3>
<p>Reverend George Whitefield read Jonathan Edwards' <em>Faithful Narrative</em> in Savannah, Georgia, and embarked upon his career as an itinerant preacher. He drew crowds of over 20,000 and his booming voice could be heard by all. Whitefield was most popular due to his bombastic style. His New England Crusade lasted 75 days, covered 800 miles, and logged 175 sermons.8</p>
<p>Whitefield concludes a number of his sermons in the same manner.</p>

<p>Many years after these sermons, the Calvinistic Methodist <em>Confession of Faith</em> was brought by Welsh settlers to central New York state circa 1826. For six years, around 1742, George Whitefield was the leader of Welsh Calvinists.</p>
<p>In the <em>Confession of Faith</em>, paragraph 4 defines the trinity as: &quot;the Father an eternal Person, the Son an eternal Person, the Holy Ghost an eternal Person; but three persons one eternal God.&quot; Similarly, the Book of Mormon refers to &quot;Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one eternal God&quot; (Alma 11:44). Paragraph 26 of the <em>Confession of Faith</em>, discusses regeneration, or the change wrought by God on humans. Whitefield also refers to this change in his <em>Marks of a True Conversion</em>.</p>

<h3>Jonathan Edwards, Jr.</h3>
<p>Jonathan Edwards, Jr. (1745-1801), continued in his father's footsteps, taking on the evils of Arminianism, Antinomianism, and Unitarianism. In life, his father's doctrinal opponent was Dr. Charles Chauncey, the number one defender of universal salvation. Shortly after Chauncey died, Edwards, Jr., produced a work rebutting his position that all men would eventually be saved. His grandson, Tryon Edwards, published a collection of his works in 1842. Edwards' <em>Salvation of All Men Strictly Examined; and the Endless Punishment of Those Who Die Impenitent, Argued and Defended Against the Objections and Reasonings of the Late Rev. Doctor Charles Chauncey, of Boston, in His Book Entitled &quot;The Salvation of All Men,&quot; Etc.</em>, was first published in 1789.9</p>
<p>Compare the following similarites and concepts in Edwards and the Book of Mormon. The page numbering of Edwards' 1789 <em>Universal Salvation</em> is from the 1842 collection.</p>

<p>When his father was dismissed as a pastor, the young Edwards moved with his family to an Indian mission, where he learned the Mohican language. In 1788, he published an elaborate study comparing Mohican to Hebrew. The title offers an explanation of Indian origins similar to the Book of Mormon: <em>Observations on the Language of the Muhhekaneew Indians; in Which the Extent of That Language in North America is Shown; its Genius Grammatically Traced; and Some of its Peculiarities, and Some Instances of Analogy Between That and the Hebrew are Pointed Out</em>.10 It is reprinted in the 1842 collection.</p>
<p>Edwards, Jr., delivered a sermon, reproduced in pamphlet form, to Samuel Huntington, governor of Connecticut and the general assembly on May 8, 1794, entitled <em>The Necessity of the Belief of Christianity by the Citizens of the State, in Order to our political Prosperity</em>.11 Compare his style of framing an argument to the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>Edwards attacks the Universalist doctrine of short-term punishment. The point of the sermon is that the threat of eternal punishment will foster more obedience than a slap on the wrist would. The Book of Mormon makes the same case with the same New Testament paraphrases.</p>

<p>Jonathan Edwards, Sr., wrote extensively on the concept of the will. For example he says, &quot;beings who have will and choice, whereby as voluntary agents, they are, and act, as it becomes them to be and to act.&quot;12 The Book of Mormon also addresses the subject. Alma 12:31 states, &quot;placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures.&quot; And 2 Nephi 2:16 says, &quot;God gave unto man that he should act for himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Edwards was a student of John Locke (1632-1704). Locke uses the phrase &quot;state of nature&quot; (cf. Alma 41:11) repeatedly in his Second Treatise, <em>Of Civil Government</em>.13 This phrase has been demonstrated throughout the various works of this study. Locke, in the same chapter, uses the phrase &quot;never was, nor ever will be.&quot; Edwards, Jr., writes, &quot;ever was or ever will be,&quot; in his <em>Universal Salvation Examined</em>. Shakespeare, in <em>Richard the Third</em>, uses &quot;never was nor never will be.&quot; The Book of Mormon has &quot;never was nor ever will be&quot; (Alma 30:28). The significant thread is that these phrases are not biblical.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;an ignominious death&quot; (Alma 1:15) has also been shown to exist in these various resources. Additionally, it can be located in <em>Gulliver's Travels</em>, Chapter VI. Coincidentally, in Chapter VI, Lemuel Gulliver tells the reader, &quot;having been born of plain honest parents,&quot; while Nephi states, &quot;having been born of goodly parents&quot; (1 Nephi 1:1). Incredibly, Nephi has a brother named Lemuel.</p>
<p>Noted LDS historian B. H. Roberts was well aware of the fact that the Book of Mormon reflects the influence of popular preachers like Edwards and Whitefield. In his work <em>A Book of Mormon Study</em>, Roberts does not itemize word for word parallels, but rather demonstrates that the conversion process described by Edwards is repeated in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is clearly established now that these scenes of religious frenzy were common in the vicinage where Joseph Smith resided in his youth and early manhood. The writings of Jonathan Edwards were commonly accessible throughout New England in those days; and Joseph Smith himself came in contact with these emotional phenomena in his own experience after their rebirth in the early decades of the 19th century. The question is, did his knowledge of these things lead to their introduction into the book of Mormon narrative? I think it cannot be questioned but where there is sufficient resemblance between the Book of Mormon instances of religious emotionalism and those cited in the foregoing quotations from the works of Edwards et al. to justify the thought that the latter might well have suggested and indeed become the source of the former.</p>
There can be no doubt but what the style of preaching, exhortation, warning, praying, admonition together with the things emphasized and the ends aimed at in such work of the Christian ministry as came to the attention of Joseph Smith were all largely and deeply influenced by those first and greatest evangelical popular preachers of Protestant Christianity, John Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, and Dr. Thomas Coke et al. In saying this I am not unmindful of the fact that these great lights of the Protestant Churches wrought their work in the generation preceding the one in which Joseph Smith lived, and that he never came in contact with them - Wesley, Whitefield, and Dr. Coke on their several visits to America, or with Dr. Edwards in New England. Still that revival of religion which marked the early decades of the 19th century, with which Joseph Smith was familiar, took on pretty much all of its coloring from the spirit and manner in which these above named evangelists conducted their work. The generation of men following them - the men with whom Joseph Smith came in contact, during his boyhood and early manhood, and through whom he heard of these &quot;giants&quot; of ultra-Protestantism of the former generation were but imitators of these in spirit, in matter, and in manner.14</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#conclusion" name="conclusion" class="heading-link" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A legitimate question to ask would be, why would the author of the Book of Mormon so blatantly incorporate phrases not only from the Bible, but also from other popular writers? The answer may be that it was an acceptable practice of the day. The Bible was an unquestioned source of truth. Mercy Otis Warren offered her &quot;moral observations&quot; throughout her <em>History</em>. David Ramsay plagiarized from the <em>Annual Register</em>.15 Consider the following explanation from Lester H. Cohen, modern editor of Ramsay's <em>History</em>. </p>
<blockquote>First, scholary citation as we know it was not an issue for eighteenth-century writers, who honored the practice, if at all, only in the most irregular and idiosyncratic manner. Second, eighteenth-century American histories were performances, not proofs; they more nearly resemble sermons, which inspire by enunciating principles and applying them to human situations, than scientific or legal discourses, which depend for their cogency and persuasiveness on their marshalling of evidence.16</blockquote>
<p>In the same way, the Book of Mormon is more sermon than history, more performance and imagination than proof, depending more on inspiration than on evidence. It is a sermon, a political speech, an allegory, and a mirror of the age in which it was produced.</p>
